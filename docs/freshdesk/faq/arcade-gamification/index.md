<summary><strong>How are the points calculated for the Leaderboard?</strong></summary>

Every ticket that an agent handles/resolves can help him/her gain points. The number of points to be awarded to 상담원 can be set by the 관리자 under **관리자 > Agent Productivity > Arcade.****![이미지](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/헬프데스크/attachments/production/42921510/original/Jcjg4ddnU4gajedH-ZMkI1fEqfbaY6Ey5w.png?1547650910)**There are four trophies in Freshdesk, that are offered to the 상담원 with the highest number of points in the Leaderboard, each based on different criteria:- **Most Valuable Player:** Agent with the most overall points for the current month.
- **고객 'Wow' Champion:** Agent with the maximum 고객 Satisfaction points for the current month.
- **Sharpshooter:** Agent with the highest First Call Resolution (ticket was solved with only one interaction between agent and 고객) for the current month.
- **Speed Racer:** Agent with the maximum points for Fast Resolution (ticket was solved in under an hour) for the current month.The Leaderboard is reset on the first of every month so everyone can start over with a clean slate.You can have a look at [this article](https://지원.freshdesk.com/지원/solutions/articles/40873-leaderboards-trophies-and-badges) for further information on the leaderboard.

<details>
<summary><strong>왜 aren't my points updated on the Leaderboard yet, even though I've completed a quest인가요?</strong></summary>

The leaderboard is a back-end operation and, as such, takes a while to be updated. There will be a delay in updating points, based on the queue.You can rest assured that the points will definitely be updated soon. If the delay is too long, please send an 이메일 to [지원@freshdesk.com](mailto:지원@freshdesk.com).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>왜 are the points I previously earned by completing a quest no longer credited to me인가요?</strong></summary>

If the actions that led to you achieving the quest in the first place were later **canceled or nullified,** the points awarded for the quest will be retracted as well.For example, if you had a quest to resolve 10 티켓 in a day and you did so, you'd be awarded the respective points for that quest. But, at a later point in time, if any one of those 티켓 is **reopened,** the quest would be canceled and the points removed.
