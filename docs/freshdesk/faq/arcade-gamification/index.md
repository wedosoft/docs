<summary><strong>How are the points calculated for the Leaderboard?</strong></summary>

Every ticket that an agent handles/resolves can help him/her gain points. The number of points to be awarded to agents can be set by the Admin under **Admin > Agent Productivity > Arcade.****![Image](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/helpdesk/attachments/production/42921510/original/Jcjg4ddnU4gajedH-ZMkI1fEqfbaY6Ey5w.png?1547650910)**There are four trophies in Freshdesk, that are offered to the agents with the highest number of points in the Leaderboard, each based on different criteria:- **Most Valuable Player:** Agent with the most overall points for the current month.
- **Customer 'Wow' Champion:** Agent with the maximum Customer Satisfaction points for the current month.
- **Sharpshooter:** Agent with the highest First Call Resolution (ticket was solved with only one interaction between agent and customer) for the current month.
- **Speed Racer:** Agent with the maximum points for Fast Resolution (ticket was solved in under an hour) for the current month.The Leaderboard is reset on the first of every month so everyone can start over with a clean slate.You can have a look at [this article](https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/40873-leaderboards-trophies-and-badges) for further information on the leaderboard.

<summary><strong>How do I create custom quests?</strong></summary>

To create custom quests, please navigate to **Admin > Agent Productivity > Arcade > Quests** and choose to either edit the default quests or add new ones of your choice.[This article](https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/40870-creating-a-new-quest) will give you a step-by-step insight into how you can create new quests.

<details>
<summary><strong>Why aren't my points updated on the Leaderboard yet, even though I've completed a quest?</strong></summary>

The leaderboard is a back-end operation and, as such, takes a while to be updated. There will be a delay in updating points, based on the queue.You can rest assured that the points will definitely be updated soon. If the delay is too long, please send an email to [support@freshdesk.com](mailto:support@freshdesk.com).

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>Why are the points I previously earned by completing a quest no longer credited to me?</strong></summary>

If the actions that led to you achieving the quest in the first place were later **canceled or nullified,** the points awarded for the quest will be retracted as well.For example, if you had a quest to resolve 10 tickets in a day and you did so, you'd be awarded the respective points for that quest. But, at a later point in time, if any one of those tickets is **reopened,** the quest would be canceled and the points removed.

<summary><strong>How will agents be notified when they complete a quest?</strong></summary>
