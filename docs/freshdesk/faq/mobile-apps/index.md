<summary><strong>I am trying to setup the 헬프데스크 on my iPhone and it's prompts me for my company url. Please help me!</strong></summary>

When you are on the go, you would want to have Freshdesk wired to your phone to track the notifications on the 티켓. We do have a mobile app that would help you check 티켓, respond to them and track customers as well as social channels. Furthermore, attending calls on the app has never been more convenient as you would be able to return them from the app itself.Once you set this up, the first step would be to enter the company URL which would be the **"****계정 URL"** (yourcompany.freshdesk.com) that you use to 로그인 to the 포털.  If you are using a custom URL for your Freshdesk 계정, you could make use of that as well, while logging in.

Freshdesk app provides a wide range of filters that help you narrow down your ticket views based on your preference. For example, the Priority field allows you to filter and view 티켓 based on the ticket priority - High, low, medium, or urgent.You can filter the 티켓 by source, type, status, 상담원 assigned to, tags, products, and even the custom fields that you have created.Also, you can view the 티켓 based on various date and time filters and further choose a day or specific time period. For example,  you can view the 티켓 resolved or closed in the past 1 hour.- Created: View 티켓 based on the ticket creation date or time.
- Closed at: View 티켓 closed at a particular time or day.
- Resolved at: View 티켓 resolved at a particular time or day

You can simply choose "All unresolved 티켓" default ticket view. The ticket list views save you time and help you quickly identify 티켓 based on your preference.![이미지](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/헬프데스크/attachments/production/50008450292/original/r1K5nBidNTUmWLoR7Ke1lqhZGwo526pSgQ.png?1685011620)The ticket filtering feature on a Freshdesk mobile app is easy and straightforward.
