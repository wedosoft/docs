## 📋 일반 질문

<summary><strong>I am trying to setup the helpdesk on my iPhone and it's prompts me for my company url. Please help me!</strong></summary>

When you are on the go, you would want to have Freshdesk wired to your phone to track the notifications on the tickets. We do have a mobile app that would help you check tickets, respond to them and track customers as well as social channels. Furthermore, attending calls on the app has never been more convenient as you would be able to return them from the app itself.Once you set this up, the first step would be to enter the company URL which would be the **"****account URL"** (yourcompany.freshdesk.com) that you use to login to the portal.  If you are using a custom URL for your Freshdesk Account, you could make use of that as well, while logging in.

By using filters, you can quickly find the tickets you need to work on and ensure that you're providing timely and effective support to your customers.Freshdesk mobile app on Andriod and iOS both, allows users to use default and custom drop-down fields in Freshdesk as filters to find a specific list of tickets.

Freshdesk app provides a wide range of filters that help you narrow down your ticket views based on your preference. For example, the Priority field allows you to filter and view tickets based on the ticket priority - High, low, medium, or urgent.You can filter the tickets by source, type, status, agents assigned to, tags, products, and even the custom fields that you have created.Also, you can view the tickets based on various date and time filters and further choose a day or specific time period. For example,  you can view the tickets resolved or closed in the past 1 hour.- Created: View tickets based on the ticket creation date or time.
- Closed at: View tickets closed at a particular time or day.
- Resolved at: View tickets resolved at a particular time or day
- Resolution due by: View tickets that must be resolved before a particular day or time.**Viewing filtered tickets**
The ticket list view lets you check the tickets with a list of filters automatically applied. Each time you choose a view, the tickets will be displayed with a list of filters applied.

<summary><strong>As an admin, why can't I see the admin settings on the mobile app?</strong></summary>

As of now, the mobile app is designed for an agent when they are on-the-go and to respond or makes updates to tickets with high priority and need attention when you are away from office. Admin settings would be part of the configuration for workflows and so, it is currently a part of the Web App only and not part of the Freshdesk Mobile App.
