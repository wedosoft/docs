<summary><strong>the size limit for attachments to a ticket reply은 무엇인가요?</strong></summary>

Freshdesk lets you send and receive emails with an attachment size limit of **20 MB**/conversation for accounts on the Blossom and above 요금제. For Sprout and trial accounts, the attachment size limit is 15 MB.By default, the content of the 이메일 (excluding attachments) has a 15 MB limit per conversation.However, if you are looking to attach bigger files, you can use **Dropbox** as a workaround. Once you integrate Freshdesk with Dropbox, you can hotlink any file from your Dropbox 계정 (with unlimited file size), and use it as an attachment inside Freshdesk. This file can be directly opened from Dropbox whenever someone clicks on it, and will not be stored anywhere on our end. Another alternative is **OneDrive** which could also help you add files with a greater MB value.**참고:** We do not recommend that you use heavy HTML content inside your 티켓. Instead, you can attach them as separate files inside the ticket just like any other attachment.

Each tag has a **character limit of 32**.Once a tag is created, you can associate it with 티켓, Contact, and Articles.

In Freshdesk, we provide few options to protect your 헬프데스크 from any possible spam 티켓 coming from sources like 포털 and 이메일.For spam 티켓 created via 포털,  enable CAPTCHA on your 고객 지원 포털. Navigate to **관리자 > Channels > Portals > Edit > Manage sections** and select the **'Enable CAPTCHA to help avoid spam'** option.![이미지](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/헬프데스크/attachments/production/50009297840/original/486-e4ikj4rbeucc4fPJU2vh8SykaIxaWA.png?1693235821)For spam 티켓 coming via 이메일, we enable Proactive Spam Filter from the backend. This spam filter will check all the 티켓 coming through the 이메일 channel and based on certain pre-defined conditions, a spam score will be associated with each incoming 이메일 ticket. If the spam score of the 이메일 is 6 and above, the 티켓 will be marked as a spam automatically.The purpose of this feature is to ensure that you have optimum spam deflection. However, please 참고 that there are chances that some valid emails can be marked as spam, if in case these emails arrive via a Spam reporting IP or with a high spam score. You could keep track of those 티켓 in the Spam folder inside the 티켓 tab in Freshdesk and restore them if you deem that they are valid.If you would like this feature to be enabled for your 계정, please drop an 이메일 to [지원@freshdesk.com](mailto:지원@freshdesk.com). We'd be glad to assist.

Freshdesk, by default, classifies 티켓 with 4 specific flags. These flags help 상담원 quickly take notice of the ticket in question and perform necessary actions.**Flag****Description**

<summary><strong>Receiving spam emails to 지원@domain.freshdesk.com, Please help!</strong></summary>

We have been reported of multiple cases where the Russian Spammers usually create spam 티켓 by sending an 이메일 to the generic forwarding address. And this 문제 is not just specific to Freshdesk and it has been prevalent across all the 헬프데스크 softwares like Zendesk, HelpScout as well.The spammers identify the generic forwarding address [like 지원@domain.freshdesk.com or info@domain.freshdesk.com or help@domain.freshdesk.com] and they create these spam 티켓. So, using a generic forwarding address makes an 계정 vulnerable to spam influx.To mitigate such spams, there is a feature called **'Prevent Wildcard Ticket Create'** where only emails directly sent to the 이메일 address configured under the 이메일 config page in Freshdesk will be converted into 티켓. Please go to **관리자 > Channels > 이메일 > Advanced 설정** and disable **'Allow emails to be sent to the wildcard 지원 address'**Also, we would recommend using domain-specific 이메일 addresses like 지원@domain.com or help@domain.com [emails having your company's domain name] to avoid such issues. Using a domain-specific 이메일 address is going to be more advantageous for your business for the following reasons- It will help you brand the emails and replies sent by your organization from Freshdesk.
- It will allow you to have greater flexibility and control as to which emails need to be converted as 티켓 and so.
- It will be of help if you would like to use your own mail server to relay emails from and to Freshdesk through our Custom mail server feature.
- Your stakeholders will be able to receive emails authenticated by your own domain using the [DKIM](https://지원.freshdesk.com/en/지원/solutions/articles/223779) feature which ensures proper end-to-end 이메일 delivery.If you have any further queries, please drop us an 이메일 at 지원@freshdesk.com.

When the agent sends a reply and resolves or closes the ticket using the 'Send and set as resolved' or 'Send and set as closed' options, the page will be automatically redirected to the Ticket List View.This is the default behavior of the system designed to help the 상담원 to view the other 티켓 in their queue without any additional clicks.If you do not want the page to be redirected to the Ticket List View upon closing the 티켓, you can update the status of the ticket from the Ticket Properties section instead of using the 'Send and set as Resolved/Closed' options.
