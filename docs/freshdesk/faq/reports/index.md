</details>

<details>
<summary>가능한가요 to 필터 a 보고서 based on a custom text field?</summary>

<p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>As of now, we <strong>do not</strong> have the functionality to filter reports based on custom text fields, in Freshdesk. </span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}><br /></span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>Kindly create this field as a <strong>dropdown</strong> if possible to have them listed in the filters within the reports. </span></p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Do "Waiting on Customer" and "Waiting on Third Party" statuses affect the average response time?</summary>

<p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>The response time does not depend upon the <strong>Status</strong> of a Ticket. </span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}><br /></span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>So, if a ticket is moved to <strong>Waiting on Customer</strong> or <strong>Pending,</strong> the time spent in those statuses would also be considered for response time.</span></p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>How does the Top-Customer Analysis 보고서 work?</summary>

<p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>The<strong> Top-Customer Analysis</strong> Report would display metrics on which Company raises the most or least tickets. </span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}><br /></span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>To have ticket metrics displayed on this report, you would first have to associate Customers to Companies. Once this is done, the tickets raised by the requesters from a company would be tracked and the report on<strong> Top five Companies</strong> (based on ticket volume) would be generated. </span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}><br /></span></p><p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>There is a<strong> toggle button</strong> to see the <strong>top 5</strong> and<strong> bottom 5</strong> customers in each metric by clicking on the sort button in the top right</span><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}> corner.</span></p><p ><br /></p><p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>If you would like to get a report on each/all contacts and companies and not just the top/bottom 5, you can use the<strong> Export</strong> option from the Ticket List View where you can filter the tickets by Contacts or Companies. </span></p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>어떻게 할 수 있나요 get a 보고서 with customised metrics to suit my business requirements?</summary>

<p>If you require business-specific metrics to be derived from Tickets in your account, you could make use of the <a href="https://support.freshdesk.com/support/solutions/articles/226460-export-ticket-activities-from-your-helpdesk" rel="noreferrer noopener">Ticket Activities Export feature </a>within Freshdesk. Using this feature, you could extract ticket information as a JSON file into your BI tools and thereby extract metrics from the ticket activities.</p><p><br /></p><p>This way, you could create custom reports containing any metric from ticket activities, based on your business requirements.</p>
