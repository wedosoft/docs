<summary><strong>왜 is there a difference in the ticket count between a ticket export and the 보고서인가요?</strong></summary>

The** ticket export** takes into 계정 the **merged** 티켓 which are not included in the count for the 보고서.For example, if three 티켓 are merged together, the 보고서 will see that as one ticket; whereas the ticket export would see them as separate 티켓. This is one of the reasons for a discrepancy in ticket count.Merged 티켓 would not be taken into consideration while generating 보고서 in 분석Please refer to [How do I export my 티켓 from Freshdesk ](https://지원.freshdesk.com/en/지원/solutions/articles/225158)to export 티켓 from List view.
