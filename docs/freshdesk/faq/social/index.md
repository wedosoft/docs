<summary>Why are my company's posts not being converted to tickets, even though I've selected that option?</summary>

<p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>Company posts would only be converted to tickets only when an end user/customer adds a comment to the post on Facebook. The post in itself will not be immediately converted. </span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}><br /></span></p><p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>When the post is eventually converted after a user comment, the original post is also brought-in along with the ticket inside Freshdesk.</span></p><p ><br /></p><p ><br /></p><p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}><br /></span></p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>How can we choose between replying to a comment and replying to a post on Facebook?</summary>

<p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>You can either reply to the post or reply to a particular comment from Freshdesk. </span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}><br /></span></p><p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>To reply to the post, you would have to use the <strong>"Reply"</strong> button at the top or bottom of the ticket.</span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}><br /></span></p><p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>To reply to a particular comment, hover over the comment and click the reply icon to the right of the yellow space.</span></p><p><br /></p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>왜인가요 the reply option not available on a few tickets created from Facebook?</summary>

<p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>If a Facebook page is removed from Freshdesk, all the tickets which were created from that Facebook page will lose connection to that page. For those tickets, the <strong>"Reply"</strong> button would not appear, so agents will not be able to reply to that ticket anymore.</span></p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why aren't replies to direct messages from Facebook reflected in Freshdesk?</summary>

<p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>If you have enabled v2 of the Facebook integration which ensures that the messages are converted to tickets in real time.</span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}><br /></span></p><p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>To change your Facebook integration to v2, please send an email to support@freshdesk.com and we'll have this fixed.</span></p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>가능한가요 to differentiate between Direct Messages and Posts from Facebook?</summary>

<p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>Yes, it is possible to differentiate between a Facebook direct message and a Facebook post in Freshdesk. Unlike a ticket created via a Facebook post, <strong>a lock next to the Facebook icon</strong> will be present for a ticket created from a direct message in the ticket details page. </span></p><p><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}><br /></span></p><p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>However, it is not possible to differentiate between direct messages and posts from the List View in the Tickets tab.</span></p><p><br /></p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>가능한가요 to convert only those posts from Facebook which have certain hashtags?</summary>

<p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>With the Facebook integration, all visitor posts will be converted to tickets automatically once the page is connected with the Freshdesk account. However, for comments on posts, you can configure filters and/or keywords to filter posts and convert them to tickets.</span></p><p ><br /></p><p ><span style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>This can be done under <strong dir="ltr">Admin -&gt; Channels -&gt; Facebook -&gt; Edit </strong>and by choosing the option <strong >Convert only relevant posts</strong>.</span></p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why are replies sent via an agent's mailbox not being added in Facebook?</summary>

<p><span dir="ltr" style={{ fontSize: "16px" }}>For Facebook tickets, it is mandatory that the agents are logged into the portal and that they reply from the portal as well. This ensures that the reply is sent as a message to the customer. When an agent replies from the mailbox, it will only add a public note in the ticket and this won't be reflected in Facebook.</span></p><p><br /></p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>I need to add more than one 소셜 media accounts on Freshdesk</summary>

<p dir="ltr">From the Blossom plan you will have the option to add multiple Facebook pages with Freshdesk. However, in the Sprout plan you will only have an option to add one page.</p>

</details>

<details>
<summary>I can't add my facebook to Freshdesk, it says it is still paired to a deleted account.</summary>

In general, a facebook page or an account can be added only to one specific Freshdesk account. In case you have linked the same Facebook account to another Freshdesk account, please unlink the facebook page from that account and activate it in the current account.

</details>

<details>
<summary>Why am I not able to send replies to Facebook DMs from Freshdesk?</summary>

<p>Facebook has recently introduced a messaging policy which does not allow apps to send messages to customers 24 hours after they have messaged a page. </p><p><br /></p><p>For example, if a customer messages a page on 8th March 2020 at 5:00 PM, they have until 5:00 PM 9th March 2020 to respond. After this window, they cannot send a response. Please note that this is a rolling window. If the customer sends another message at 5:30 PM, they have until 5:30 PM the next day to respond.</p><p><br /></p><p>This change is in line with people’s expectations of faster responses from businesses. Please refer to Facebook's article for <a href="https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/policy/policy-overview#new_policy" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">more details around this policy</a>.<br /><br /></p><div>We've incorporated the <strong>closed beta API for Facebook direct messages in Freshdesk. </strong>So now, you will be able to respond to direct messages within a <strong>21-day window till July 15th</strong>, considering COVID-19 post which the window would be cut short to 7 days. </div><div><br /></div><div>Also, there are other ways of coping up with this situation further.</div><div><br /></div><div>You can collect their customer's contact details (email address or phone number) with an automated message. This automated message can be fired in two ways.</div><div style={{ boxSizing: "border-box", wordBreak: "break-word", overflowWrap: "break-word", color: "rgb(24, 50, 71)", fontFamily: "-apple-system, system-ui, \"Segoe UI\", Roboto, \"Helvetica Neue\", Arial, sans-serif", fontSize: "14px", fontWeight: "400", textAlign: "start", textIndent: "0px" }}><br /></div><div><strong>1. Directly from Facebook.</strong></div><div>If you have very few Facebook pages, you can set up an automated message to collect customer details from this specific section</div><div><br /><img src="#" style={{ width: "620px" }} class="fr-fic fr-dib fr-bordered" /></div><p><br /></p><p><strong>2. Using API</strong><br />If you have multiple Facebook pages integrated with your Freshdesk and have separate groups that handle just DM tickets, you can use webhooks to send an automatic reply. This requires the addition of a new feature from our end. Please reach out to us at <a href="http://support@freshdesk.com" rel="noreferrer" target="_blank">support@freshdesk.com</a> if you would like to get this feature enabled. </p>
