The authorization can run into trouble under the following scenarios:- When you are trying to authorize from your custom/vanity URL. Please try the authorization after logging into your 계정 using Freshdesk URL, which would go by YourCompanyName.freshdesk.com.- If you have SSO enabled, please try logging in using your Freshdesk credentials after bypassing your SSO, using the URL - YourCompanyName.freshdesk.com/로그인/normal.
- Please ensure if you are not logged into another Facebook 계정 on your browser at the same time. The Facebook 계정 which you are logged into would have to be an 관리자 of the Facebook page.- There could also be several reasons why you are unable to associate your Facebook page with Freshdesk.

<summary><strong>왜 are my company's posts not being converted to 티켓, even though I've selected that option인가요?</strong></summary>

Company posts would only be converted to 티켓 only when an end user/고객 adds a comment to the post on Facebook. The post in itself will not be immediately converted.When the post is eventually converted after a user comment, the original post is also brought-in along with the ticket inside Freshdesk.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>How can we choose between replying to a comment and replying to a post on Facebook?</strong></summary>

You can either reply to the post or reply to a particular comment from Freshdesk.To reply to the post, you would have to use the **"Reply"** button at the top or bottom of the ticket.To reply to a particular comment, hover over the comment and click the reply icon to the right of the yellow space.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>왜 is the reply option not available on a few 티켓 created from Facebook인가요?</strong></summary>

If a Facebook page is removed from Freshdesk, all the 티켓 which were created from that Facebook page will lose connection to that page. For those 티켓, the **"Reply"** button would not appear, so 상담원 will not be able to reply to that ticket anymore.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>왜 aren't replies to direct messages from Facebook reflected in Freshdesk인가요?</strong></summary>

If you have enabled v2 of the Facebook integration which ensures that the messages are converted to 티켓 in real time.To change your Facebook integration to v2, please send an 이메일 to 지원@freshdesk.com and we'll have this fixed.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>왜 are Agent signatures not present while replying to Social 티켓 even though they have been configured인가요?</strong></summary>

The agent signatures will not be present when replying to a Facebook post because the replies will go from the 지원 handle and not the 상담원'. Similarly, the ticket links will not be present either.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>differentiate between Direct Messages and Posts from Facebook할 수 있나요?</strong></summary>

Yes, it is possible to differentiate between a Facebook direct message and a Facebook post in Freshdesk. Unlike a ticket created via a Facebook post, **a lock next to the Facebook icon** will be present for a ticket created from a direct message in the ticket details page.However, it is not possible to differentiate between direct messages and posts from the List View in the 티켓 tab.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>convert only those posts from Facebook which have certain hashtags할 수 있나요?</strong></summary>

With the Facebook integration, all visitor posts will be converted to 티켓 automatically once the page is connected with the Freshdesk 계정. However, for comments on posts, you can configure filters and/or keywords to filter posts and convert them to 티켓.This can be done under **관리자 -> Channels -> Facebook -> Edit **and by choosing the option **Convert only relevant posts**.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>왜 are replies sent via an agent's mailbox not being added in Facebook인가요?</strong></summary>

For Facebook 티켓, it is mandatory that the 상담원 are logged into the 포털 and that they reply from the 포털 as well. This ensures that the reply is sent as a message to the 고객. When an agent replies from the mailbox, it will only add a public 참고 in the ticket and this won't be reflected in Facebook.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I need to add more than one social media accounts on Freshdesk</strong></summary>

From the Blossom 요금제 you will have the option to add multiple Facebook pages with Freshdesk. However, in the Sprout 요금제 you will only have an option to add one page.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>I can't add my facebook to Freshdesk, it says it is still paired to a deleted 계정.</strong></summary>

In general, a facebook page or an 계정 can be added only to one specific Freshdesk 계정. In case you have linked the same Facebook 계정 to another Freshdesk 계정, please unlink the facebook page from that 계정 and activate it in the current 계정.

</details>

<details>
<summary><strong>왜 am I not able to send replies to Facebook DMs from Freshdesk인가요?</strong></summary>

Facebook has recently introduced a messaging policy which does not allow apps to send messages to customers 24 hours after they have messaged a page.For example, if a 고객 messages a page on 8th March 2020 at 5:00 PM, they have until 5:00 PM 9th March 2020 to respond. After this window, they cannot send a response. Please 참고 that this is a rolling window. If the 고객 sends another message at 5:30 PM, they have until 5:30 PM the next day to respond.This change is in line with people’s expectations of faster responses from businesses. Please refer to Facebook's article for [more details around this policy](https://developers.facebook.com/docs/messenger-platform/policy/policy-overview#new_policy).We've incorporated the **closed beta API for Facebook direct messages in Freshdesk. **So now, you will be able to respond to direct messages within a **21-day window till July 15th**, considering COVID-19 post which the window would be cut short to 7 days.Also, there are other ways of coping up with this situation further.You can collect their 고객's contact details (이메일 address or phone number) with an automated message. This automated message can be fired in two ways.**1. Directly from Facebook.**If you have very few Facebook pages, you can set up an automated message to collect 고객 details from this specific section![이미지](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/헬프데스크/attachments/production/50001222086/original/Z1PxG8oRGVQLhqGxHcOPCmNS7VsvmnBmYg.png?1591702091)**2. Using API**
If you have multiple Facebook pages integrated with your Freshdesk and have separate groups that handle just DM 티켓, you can use webhooks to send an automatic reply. This requires the addition of a new feature from our end. Please reach out to us at [지원@freshdesk.com](http://지원@freshdesk.com) if you would like to get this feature enabled.

<summary><strong>Discontinuation of Twitter services on Freshdesk</strong></summary>

Freshdesk Twitter services are discontinued.Freshworks uses Twitter APIs to power tweets and DMs in Freshdesk. Over the past few weeks, Twitter has made a number of changes to its API and access tiers and recently revoked our access to Twitter. We have been engaging with Twitter to see how we can continue extending 지원; however, we have ultimately come to the decision that it will not be feasible due to the prohibitive cost involved and uncertainty around Twitter APIs for commercial offering.With this update, you can no longer use Twitter as a channel within Freshdesk to reply to tweets and DMs. Twitter services are completely discontinued, and we encourage you to use our alternative channels, like Facebook or WhatsApp, to continue engaging with your customers on social media platforms.We understand that this news may be disappointing. However, we hope our alternative solutions will help you continue engaging your customers effectively.We regret the inconvenience caused. Please write to us at [지원@freshdesk.com](mailto:지원@freshdesk.com) if you have any questions.
