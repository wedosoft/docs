<summary>I have configured the 고객 satisfaction surveys right, but when I run a quick test, I do not get the 설문조사.</summary>

<p>The surveys would not be sent to you if the <strong>requestor of the ticket is the same as an Agent</strong> email address. </p><p><br /></p><p>Hence, please try sending the survey to a ticket where your agent address isn't the requestor (preferably from your personal address). </p><p><span style="font-size: 16px;"><br /></span></p><p><br /></p>

<summary>The 고객만족도(CSAT) 설문조사 emails are not being translated. What am I missing?</summary>

<p>The CSAT survey email might not have been translated in the preferred language if any one of the following is true. <br /><br /><strong>1. </strong>The language associated with the contact seems to be incorrect. The customer’s preferred language is auto-detected by Freshdesk and saved in contact details based on their first interaction. This can be changed under <strong style="box-sizing: border-box; font-weight: bold;">Contact &gt; Edit Contact</strong>.<br /><br />2. The survey will be sent in the default language if the translations for the customer's preferred<strong> language is not uploaded or available</strong> in Freshdesk.</p><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: inherit; line-height: 1.6; word-break: normal; overflow-wrap: break-word; text-align: justify;"><br /></p><p style="box-sizing: border-box; margin-bottom: 0px; margin-left: 0px; font-size: inherit; line-height: 1.6; word-break: normal; overflow-wrap: break-word; text-align: justify;">3. The <strong>‘secondary languages’</strong> in your helpdesk should be marked as <strong>‘Visible in portal’</strong> for the surveys to be automatically translated to the corresponding languages</p>

<summary>Is it possible to send a satisfaction 설문조사 for tickets that came through Facebook?</summary>

<p>Satisfaction surveys would be triggered through email notification. When a social ticket is created, we just fetch the username of the user. So ideally, there is no direct option to send a CSAT survey for social tickets. <br />But you could integrate any third party tool and attach a survey link manually.</p>
