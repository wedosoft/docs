<summary><strong>Customers are not able to open the ticket URL in the response. How can I rectify this?</strong></summary>

When you send out responses to your customers - the ticket URL would be available to the users depending on the user permission which can be understood by navigating to **관리자 -> Channels -> Portals -> 설정**. So there are two options - logged-in users or anyone with a **public ticket **URL.Considering the question, the option in your 설정 is "logged in users" who would need to be verified to have an 계정 in your 포털 so that they could log in and check. There are two options to do this - make sure you send out an activation URL manually from the customers' tab or automate it in **Adnin > Workflows > 이메일 notifications > Requester notifications > User activation**. Finally, if you would want a quicker alternative, you could guide them to do a 비밀번호 reset on the 포털.
