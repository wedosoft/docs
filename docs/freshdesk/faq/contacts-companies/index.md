## 문제 해결

<details>
<summary>I have a problem while importing contacts. What could the issue be?</summary>

<p>As a recent user of Freshdesk, you would want to bring in all your contacts into the portal and while doing that - you get an error on the customers' tab saying "an import is already running." This is because while uploading the CSV (or excel) file, there would have been a technical glitch which would block the import. Kindly contact support (support@freshdesk.com) and ask them to kill this so that you could import the file again. </p><p><br /></p><p>Another recommendation would be to check the solution article in the "file import" page which would give you specifications about the various parameters in the file. </p>
