- Map the Fields: Freshdesk will prompt you to map the fields from the import file to the corresponding contact fields in Freshdesk. This step ensures that the data is imported accurately. Match the columns in your file with the appropriate fields in Freshdesk (e.g., name column with name field, 이메일 column with 이메일 field).
- Review and Validate: After mapping the fields, review the data to ensure everything is correctly aligned. Check for any missing on mapping.

As a recent user of Freshdesk, you would want to bring in all your 연락처 into the 포털 and while doing that - you get an 오류 on the customers' tab saying "an import is already running." This is because while uploading the CSV (or excel) file, there would have been a technical glitch which would block the import. Kindly contact 지원 (지원@freshdesk.com) and ask them to kill this so that you could import the file again.Another recommendation would be to check the 해결책 article in the "file import" page which would give you specifications about the various parameters in the file.
