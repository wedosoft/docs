<summary><strong>the best practices to delete an agent without losing their ticket details은 무엇인가요?</strong></summary>

Sometimes, 상담원 in your organization may leave or move to a different department. In such cases, you can delete those 상담원 after transferring ownership of their 티켓 to other 상담원. When you delete an agent from Freshdesk, all 티켓 assigned to that agent are automatically unassigned, and the agent will be available as a contact in your Freshdesk 계정. Here are two ways to remove an agent without losing their associated ticket details.- [Converting an agent to an occasional agent.](#Converting-an-agent-to-an-occasional-agent.)
- [Assuming the identity of the agent](#Assuming-the-identity-of-the-agent)[](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Ykod0RKGMjAxJZPYFl1OIHFs4jcerKAgg_49vA05Zos/edit#heading=h.njoufdsbses3)**Converting an agent to an occasional agent.**
You can convert a full-time agent into an occasional agent instead of deleting them and then edit the 이메일 address to a placeholder 이메일 address like: xyz@example.com. This way, you can free up an agent seat and retain the record of 티켓 assigned to the agent. Here’s how you can do it.-
Navigate to 관리자. Choose 팀 and then click on 상담원.-
Click on the Edit option next to the required agent name.-
Under the Edit 상담원 page, choose the Occasional Agent radio button as the Agent type.-
Update the 이메일 address to a placeholder 이메일 address say, [xyz@example.com](mailto:xyz@example.com).-
Click on Update agent to save the changes.![How to convert to an occasional agent in Freshdesk?](https://s3.amazonaws.com/cdn.freshdesk.com/data/헬프데스크/attachments/production/50008538142/original/QPTl0Lu2ufLnGMJGd1uu-ozxY0rwg8upvQ.gif?1686026914)**Assuming the identity of the agent**
As an 관리자, you can [assume the agent's identity](https://지원.freshdesk.com/지원/solutions/articles/97080-deleting-상담원-assuming-identities-and-understanding-role) before deleting the agent and perform a bulk action to re-assign their associated 티켓 to another agent. You can then delete the agent without worrying about the unassigned 티켓 initially assigned to them.
For a detailed demonstration, please watch the video on Youtube on 참고 자료: how to delete 상담원 in Freshdesk.

<summary><strong>How does the spam watcher in Freshdesk work?</strong></summary>

The spam watcher will check if more than 50 emails have been received from the same 이메일 address in the first 30 minutes; if so, upon the 51st 이메일, the user will be deleted and all emails from them will be sent to the spam folder.After the 60th minute, if emails are still being received from that 이메일 address, the spam watcher will block that ID and Freshdesk will not receive any further emails from them.By leveraging a variety of techniques and filters, we effectively prevent spam and unwanted messages from reaching your 헬프데스크. It's essential to 참고 that our methods and features may have evolved since then. However, here are some common techniques we employ:- Bayesian Filtering: We use Bayesian filtering, which is a statistical approach. It learns from previous spam patterns and user feedback to categorize incoming emails as spam or non-spam. As it processes more emails, it becomes better at identifying spam.
- CAPTCHA: To prevent automated bots from submitting spam 티켓, we have CAPTCHA challenges that require users to prove their humanity by solving visual puzzles or answering questions.
- 이메일 Verification: When customers create new 티켓 via 이메일, we send an 이메일 verification link to confirm the legitimacy of their 이메일 address. This ensures that only genuine 이메일 addresses can submit 티켓.
- Blacklist and Whitelist: You have control over a blacklist to block specific 이메일 addresses or domains known for sending spam. Additionally, you can create a whitelist of trusted sources to ensure 중요 emails aren't marked as spam.
- Ticket Filter Rules using automation: You can set up custom ticket filter rules/automation to automatically handle incoming 티켓 based on specific criteria. These rules help identify potential spam 티켓 for appropriate handling.
- Spam Notifications: We flag incoming 티켓 that appear to be spam and notify 상담원, so they can review and take necessary actions.
- Machine Learning: We leverage machine learning algorithms to analyze various ticket attributes and identify patterns consistent with spam or legitimate queries.Please remember that spam filtering is an ongoing process, and we continuously improve our filters to keep up with evolving spam tactics.

<summary><strong>have 상담원 with different 요금제할 수 있나요?</strong></summary>

You cannot have different 상담원 in different 요금제. Since the 요금제 and the features are 계정-based you will have to purchase all the agent seats in the same 요금제.
