# Add Members/Observers to Agent Groups

> **Note:** If you have signed up on or after 12th December 2022, please refer to this section for managing agents.

## Adding Agents to an Agent Group

Agents can be added as **Members** or **Observers** to an Agent Group within your IT service desk. For example, an HR agent can be added to the HR Agents Group as a Member to undertake all activities related to the HR department. This agent can also be added as an Observer in the IT Agents Group to follow up and have contextual information regarding employee fulfillment needs from the IT department.

### Members
Agents added as **Members** to a group can perform actions within the group based on their Role Scope & Permissions. They can view and access tickets, can be assigned tickets, and work on other items (tasks, problems, changes, releases, assets) that belong to the group.

### Observers
Agents added as **Observers** to a group can access tickets, assets, changes, and other items that the group owns, based on their Roles and Scope within the service desk. But, they cannot be assigned any work items within the group either explicitly, or by automatic Round Robin assignment.

> **Info:** Agents can be added as Observers only in the Enterprise pricing plan.

> **Tip:** Before you start adding agents to a group, it's important to create and manage an agent group. Learn how.

## Best Practices

- **Member vs Observer assignment:** Carefully consider whether an agent needs full access (Member) or just monitoring capabilities (Observer)
- **Group organization:** Structure groups based on departments, skills, or responsibilities for better ticket management
- **Permission alignment:** Ensure agent roles and group permissions are properly aligned
- **Regular review:** Periodically review group memberships to maintain appropriate access levels
