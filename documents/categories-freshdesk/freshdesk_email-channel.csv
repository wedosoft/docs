For example, outbound emails can be sent to:   inform customers about scheduled maintenance and downtime  announce unexpected incidents and provide recovery instructions  simply check in with users with whom they share a customer success relationship   This article contains:  About outbound Emails  Limits on outbound emails    Enable outbound email  Send an outbound email  FAQs     About outbound Emails  Every outbound email sent from Freshdesk is immediately converted into a ticket. This email is treated as a one-on-one conversation between the agent and the recipient of the email. Though it becomes a ticket immediately, it will not have the characteristics of a normal ticket. However, when the recipient replies to the email, it will be treated as a normal ticket.    Note: You can send outbound emails using the New Email option. The option will be visible only if you enable the Allow agents to initiate conversation with customers in Advanced Settings.     The following table gives you an overview of the differences between a normal ticket and an outbound email ticket:  Property  Normal ticket  Outbound email ticket  Ticket status  By default, the ticket status will be Open  By default, the ticket status will be Closed.  You can choose a different status based on your use case.  Ticket SLA  SLA timers start immediately  SLA timers start only after the customer responds to the ticket.  When you send an outbound email and manually change the ticket status to Open (or any status with SLA timer ON), the Due by time and the First Response time will be set immediately.  If the customer doesn't reply on time, you may violate the SLA while you are waiting. So, we recommend creating outbound emails assigned to a status that has the SLA timer OFF (like Closed or Resolved).  You can choose to deactivate the pre-configured Automation Update rule, which reopens tickets when the customer responds. This prevents outbound email tickets from being set to Open when a customer responds and will ensure that SLAs are not activated.  Email notification  New ticket created notification will be sent.   The following email notifications will not be sent:   New ticket created  Agent Closes the Ticket   Also, user activation email will not be sent to the recipient.    Customer satisfaction surveys    Satisfaction surveys will be sent out based on the setting.  The survey will not be sent even despite the CSAT settings.    Analytics   FCR% will be calculated  FCR% will not be taken into consideration as the conversation is being initiated by the agent.  First response SLA will be calculated based on when the agent sent out the first response on the ticket.  The first response SLA will be the response that the agent sends after the customer responds to the initial email.  Automation rules  Automation rules will be executed on the creation of tickets.  Automation rules will not be executed for an outbound email ticket  Supervisor rules will be executed.  Automation rules will not be executed on an outbound ticket.  Without replies from the customer, the conditions Hours since agent/customer responded in the Supervisor rule will not be considered.   Limits on outbound emails  We have implemented a Fair Usage Policy to limit spam attacks and enhance security.

You'll see a banner that says, ""Your account has crossed the maximum hourly limit for outgoing emails. Please get in touch with our support team to know more.""   Enable outbound email  To allow agents to send outbound emails, enable the option from Advanced Settings.   As an admin, go to Admin > Channels > Email and click Advanced Settings.  Enable the option Allow agents to initiate conversation with customers. Once enabled, the agents can see the New email option.       You can also use the Customize From Email Address app to set default support addresses for outbound emails.   Go to Admin > Support operations > Apps. If you don't have the app installed, install it from the Marketplace. You will need your API Key.  Click Manage Apps.  Next to the app, click Settings > Edit settings.  Select Source from the dropdown.  Select Outbound Email and the relevant support address and click Save.     Send an outbound email  To compose a new outbound email:   Click New in the top-right corner of the agent portal and select New email.   On the Send an email page, enter the following details:  From: Choose the relevant option from your configured support emails.  To: Choose the primary recipient of the email. If the recipient is not in your Contacts, they'll be added once the email is sent. Note: By default, you can add only one recipient in the ""To"" field; however, if your admin enables the ""Flexible Email Recipients"" in Email Advanced Settings, you can add more of recipients in the ""To"" field.  (Optional) Click Add CC or Add BCC to add multiple secondary recipients.  Subject: Craft your email subject. This doubles as the title for the ticket that is created to track this email conversation.  Description: Create your email body. Use the formatting options to create rich text and media and modify your email signature.    Optionally, configure any properties for the subsequent ticket. Mandatory fields are already displayed. Click Show more fields to configure other ticket fields.  Optionally, mark the Send another checkbox to create another email after sending this one.  Review your email and click Send.      Note: If you have Multiple products (Pro plan onwards), the Product field will not be displayed on this page. Instead, the field will be automatically filled after the ticket is created using the product associated with the From address.     Ticket workflow for outbound emails  When you send the outbound email, it is automatically converted into a ticket. By default, a ticket created this way has the following properties:   Agent—you. Since you sent the outbound email, you'll likely be the one to continue responding to it.  Requester—your email recipient. This way, outbound email tickets are included when you use the Contact or Company filters in ticket list views and analytics.  Status—Closed. This is so that your SLA timers don't start automatically.      Note: Your default ticket list views do not include closed tickets. To track tickets created by outbound emails, set the Sources filter to ""Outbound Email"" and save it as a custom view. See Understand the Ticket List View.     Once the customer responds to the outbound email, their reply is appended to the ticket body. The ticket status is changed to Open and the SLA timers start running.     FAQs   Can I send emails in bulk and create separate tickets for each customer? You can only email one recipient with the New Email method, though you can add multiple CC or BCC recipients. To send outbound emails in bulk and create individual tickets for each customer, use the Proactive Outreach feature.      Can I monitor the number of outbound emails that agents send?  Yes. On the Tickets page, set the Sources filter to ""Outbound Email"". This gives you the list of tickets as well as a total count. You can use the same filter in your Analytics reports and group by agents to get agent counts. If you use the Agent Reply metric, you can also understand the number of emails an agent sends per ticket.      Why is my support email address not listed in the ""From"" field?  If your configured support email address is not listed in the From field of a new email, try the following:    Confirm if your email address is verified.  Only verified addresses can be used to send outbound emails from Freshdesk. Go to Admin > Channels > Email and check if the status is Verified.    If you use marketplace apps like the Customize From Email Address app, check the app's configuration. Go to Admin > Support operations > Apps and click Manage Apps. Click Settings > Edit settings for the relevant app and verify your configuration.    If you just set up a new support email, it might not show up if your page cache hasn't been refreshed. Wait a few minutes or hard reset your page (Chrome and Firefox: Ctrl+F5 for Windows or Cmd+Shift+R for Mac).      What happens when an agent replies to an email notification from the agent email address? When an agent replies to the thread of an already existing ticket from their mailbox, it will be added as a public note on the ticket. If the agent sends an email to the support email address as a new thread, it will create a new ticket with the agent as the requestor.  To append a new email to an existing ticket, include the Ticket ID at the beginning of the Subject line of the ticket in the format, [#{{ticket.id}}]. For example, add [#1234] at the start of the subject of a new email to append that email to Ticket number 1234.      How to prevent ticket creation if the support email address is in the CC or BCC? If one of your support email addresses is added to the CC field in an email conversation, the email thread will be converted to a ticket. By default, emails will be forwarded from your primary inbox to Freshdesk as tickets. However, you can set up a Ticket Creation rule to automatically delete the ticket if the email address in Ticket CC is a support email address.      How to solve ""An internal error occurred. Please contact support"" error? When you try to edit email notifications by signing up with a public domain address (such as gmail.com or outlook.com), you may see an error saying An internal error occurred. Please contact support. In such cases, you can edit the email notifications only if you have more than 10 tickets in your account.  If you continue to face further issues, contact support@freshdesk.com with your Freshdesk URL.      Can I manually forward tickets from my support email address to Freshdesk forwarding email address? By default, a ticket will not be created in Freshdesk when the From and To addresses of an email are both the support email addresses. This is done to avoid duplicate ticket issues. Please try sending the email from another email address to create the ticket.      How to ensure all replies are sent from only one support email address? By default, a reply to a ticket is sent via the support email address from which that ticket was created. However, if you want to reply through an email address irrespective of the email address from which the ticket was created, you can install the Customize 'From' Email Address app (Go to Admin > Support Operations > Apps > Get More Apps).

Troubleshooting steps to resolve IP blacklisting  If your IP is blacklisted:   Identify the reason for blacklisting. Possible reasons could include unsolicited emails, malware, or being part of a compromised shared hosting network.  Take actions to solve the issues:  Run security scans to identify and resolve any compromised systems or malware infections.   Follow best practices to avoid spam. Avoid sending unsolicited emails and make sure your recipients have opted in to receive your messages.    Implement security measures such as strong passwords, firewalls, and up-to-date software to prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of being compromised.    Implement email authentication mechanisms like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to verify your email's authenticity and reduce the chances of being flagged as spam.    Remove malicious content to prevent further issues.    Follow the delisting process of the respective blacklist, providing the required evidence. Each blacklist will have its own delisting process, which typically involves submitting a request through their website or following their instructions. Provide all the necessary information and evidence to support your request for removal.    Regularly monitor and maintain good practices to ensure you stay off blacklists.

DKIM verification and SPF enhance email security, establish the sender's legitimacy, and ensure better email deliverability. This reduces the chances of emails being marked as spam or phishing emails. Note: DKIM setup is not applicable when using a custom mailbox.    Invalid recipient email address: Ensure that the recipient’s email address is correct and not misspelled.    IP Blacklisting: Use tools like MXToolbox or Spamhaus to verify the blacklist status. IP blacklisting can impact the email delivery and online reputation. Check out the troubleshooting section below to see how you can resolve this.    Spam Filtering: Verify if the recipient’s email server is operational and if the email is not landing in the spam folder. Avoid spam-triggering content like suspicious attachments or excessive punctuation. To view the Spam folder, click on the Spam view from the Ticket View filters.   Automations or Triggers in Freshdesk: Ensure that automation rules are not filtering out emails.    Troubleshooting steps to resolve IP blacklisting  If your IP is blacklisted:   Identify the reason for blacklisting. Possible reasons could include unsolicited emails, malware, or being part of a compromised shared hosting network.  Take actions to solve the issues:  Run security scans to identify and resolve any compromised systems or malware infections.   Follow best practices to avoid spam. Avoid sending unsolicited emails and make sure your recipients have opted in to receive your messages.    Implement security measures such as strong passwords, firewalls, and up-to-date software to prevent unauthorized access and reduce the risk of being compromised.    Implement email authentication mechanisms like SPF, DKIM, and DMARC to verify your email's authenticity and reduce the chances of being flagged as spam.    Remove malicious content to prevent further issues.    Follow the delisting process of the respective blacklist, providing the required evidence. Each blacklist will have its own delisting process, which typically involves submitting a request through their website or following their instructions. Provide all the necessary information and evidence to support your request for removal.    Regularly monitor and maintain good practices to ensure you stay off blacklists.

If you use Gmail as a default or custom mail server in Freshdesk and if you have already configured basic authentication, follow these steps,   Go to Admin > Channels > Email. You will see the list of email addresses in your account. A warning message will be displayed under the email address that was authorized using the basic authentication.   Click on the link to reauthorize the mailbox. You will be redirected to the Email settings page.    Click Sign in with Google to reauthorize your account.   If you have multiple Gmail-based support emails, repeat the OAuth/reauthorization step for each support email.     For any further assistance drop an email to support@freshdesk.com.     ",7,2024-09-27T17:45:28+05:30,50000178823,,,,,269977,Managing your Outbound Emails,,2015-08-13T15:29:50+05:30,2024-11-19T19:53:54+05:30,161177,1,2,,6,161177,Email Channel,Use your email channel to its full potential with all the information you need about email ticketing.,2017-10-05T15:41:24+05:30,2024-03-14T12:54:26+05:30,6,gmail-basic-auth-deprecation-and-migration-to-oauth,managing-your-outbound-emails,email-channel,/freshdesk/email-channel/managing-your-outbound-emails/gmail-basic-auth-deprecation-and-migration-to-oauth.mdx

For example, a requester whose profile language is set as French will get notifications and alerts in French, while a German requester would be notified in the German language.      In order to dynamically notify customers, in their preferred language, you first need to add the list of languages through which you will be supporting users. You can then edit the notification content for each language.     Add Supported Languages     If your plan allows you to support customers across multiple languages, you can add any number of 'Supported Languages' in your helpdesk. This is in addition to your default primary language. You can add supported languages from the Helpdesk Rebranding page.   Log into your account as an administrator.  Navigation:  For Freshdesk, go to Admin > Account > Helpdesk Settings and click Manage Settings. Note: You will redirected to the the Languages page, where you can add your preferred language. For details, check this article.    Your default helpdesk language is listed as your Primary language.  In the Supported Languages text box enter all the other languages you want to support.  Click Save once you are done.  Now you will be able to set up notifications in all these languages.        Set up multi-language notifications   Log into your account as an admin.  Navigation:  For Freshdesk, go to Admin > Workflows > Email Notifications.   For Freshdesk Omni, go to Admin > Configuration and Workflows > Email Notifications.    Click Edit next to the notification you want to set up in multiple languages.  All supported languages you have added are available as individual 'Tabs'.  Edit the content for the notification in each language (You might consider using a professional translator’s help here).  If you leave a particular language's notification blank or choose to NOT edit it, requesters in this language will still receive notifications in your primary language.   If you need to refer the primary notification, you can Show or Hide the Original Content by clicking on the link just below the tabs.        Click Save to save your translations.      Keeping language-specific notifications updated     Whenever you edit the primary language notification, you can choose to flag all corresponding language-specific notifications as Outdated. The red exclamation next to a notification (on the main email notifications page), or corresponding to a particular language (inside each specific notification) indicates that the notification has been flagged as Outdated.            To mark a translation as outdated:   Check the box below the primary notification that says Mark translations as outdated.  Hit Save.   Once you have edited the language specific notification, you can click on the checkbox that says Mark this translation as up-to-date.      Note: Outdated translations will still continue to be used in notifications sent to requesters and agents until you update them.      Setting the profile language for requesters     Freshdesk automatically sets the requester's profile language the first time they raise a ticket. Freshdesk would try detecting the language by checking the first 15 words in the email of the first email. Upon doing so, the corresponding language would be associated for the contact. All subsequent notifications are sent to this requester in their profile language, provided this language is set as one of the supported languages in your helpdesk. You can also manually edit the profile language of a user by editing their details from the contacts or agents page.     To manually edit the profile language of a requester (contact):   Go to Customers tab.  Click on the Edit button next to the contact whose language needs to be updated.  Language will be listed as a customer attribute, you can choose the language of the customer from the drop-down list.  Hit Save Changes.  Now all the email notifications to that customer will be sent out in the updated language (provided you've already added the content of the notification in that language).   To change the profile language of an agent:   Click on Admin > Agents.  Click on the Edit button next to the name of the agent whose language you want to edit.  Choose the Agent language from the language drop-down list.  Hit Save.  Now the customer portal of the agent and their email notifications will appear in this new language you've chosen.

However, you can customize your email subject line to show or hide the ticket ID and make it more personal. In this case, please note that the customer email replies will still be added to the corresponding ticket thread based on the email threading logic and will not get converted to a new ticket.      This article provides instructions on:   Ticket ID in the subject of the reply emails   Ticket ID in automatic email notifications    Ticket ID in the subject of the reply emails      To automatically add the ticket ID information in the reply email subject when responding to tickets,       Log in as an Administrator to your Freshdesk account.  Navigation:  For Freshdesk, go to Admin > Workflows > Email notifications.    Click on the Templates tab.     Click on the Edit button next to the Agent Reply Template.  By default, the subject section in the template will only have the {{ticket.subject}} placeholder which fetches the ticket subject information dynamically when responding to tickets.  To add the Ticket ID placeholder in all agent replies, click the Insert Placeholder option and select Ticket ID from the Tickets option.     Click Save.           Note: We recommend adding ticket ID placeholder with the format [#{{ticket.id}}] in the subject section of the agent reply template to help email threading in Freshdesk.      When you remove the ticket ID from the email subject, the ticket ID will be removed only from ticket replies. However, all the email notifications will still have the ticket ID in the subject by default. If you do not want to include the ticket ID in the subject, you can remove it from the below-mentioned notifications.     You can also add ticket ID placeholder (format [#{{ticket.id}}]) in the Agent Forward Template to include ticket ID information when forwarding emails in tickets.       Ticket ID in automatic email notifications     If you would like to add/remove the ticket ID information in various email notifications sent to your customers, please follow the steps below:     Under Admin > Workflows > Email notifications, choose the Requester Notifications tab.    The ticket ID placeholder can be automatically included in the subject line for these notifications:    New ticket created    Agent adds comment to a ticket    Agent solves the ticket    Agent closes the ticket      Click on the Edit button next to these notifications.        Based on your requirements, add/remove the [#{{ticket.id}}] placeholder from the subject section.   When customers reply to the email notification emails, such emails will be appended to the corresponding older tickets based on the email threading logic. For example, when the ticket requester replies to the email notification that says Ticket #12345 has been received in your helpdesk, their reply is appended to ticket #12345, and no new ticket will be created.        Similar to adding/removing ticket ID in agent replies and requester email notifications, you can customize your emails by adding content as per your business usecase and inserting various placeholders from the helpdesk, ticket, ticket fields, contact, and company section which will dynamically pull in the appropriate data accordingly.                ",4,2024-05-15T01:14:25+05:30,50000761347,"freshdesk_old_sprout,freshdesk_free,css_growth,omnichannel_old_estate,omnichannel_growth",Hiding ticket ID from the subject line of support emails,Make your emails personal by hiding the ticket ID from the reply emails you send out or forward.,"hide ticket ID, remove ticket ID, ticket ID in subject line, hide ticket number",272827,Setting up Email notifications,,2017-04-06T18:06:19+05:30,2023-11-09T21:37:56+05:30,161177,1,3,,6,161177,Email Channel,Use your email channel to its full potential with all the information you need about email ticketing.,2017-10-05T15:41:24+05:30,2024-03-14T12:54:26+05:30,6,customizing-email-subject-in-tickets,setting-up-email-notifications,email-channel,/freshdesk/email-channel/setting-up-email-notifications/customizing-email-subject-in-tickets.mdx

This keeps agents and customers informed and stay up-to-date on their ticket activities, ensuring a seamless communication experience.         TABLE OF CONTENTS   Access Email Notifications  Agent Notifications  Requester Notifications  CC Notifications  Templates  Changing Font Settings         Access Email Notifications     To access the different email notifications, log in as an administrator.    Navigation:    For Freshdesk, go to Admin > Workflows > Email Notifications.            You will notice that there are four tabs on this page, viz. Agent Notifications, Requester Notifications, CC Notifications, and Reply Templates.    Agent Notifications: This gives the ability to alert the agent through email notifications when a customer replies to a ticket, when a ticket is assigned to the agent etc. so that they stay in the know of ticket activities in the helpdesk and action tickets accordingly.    Requestor Notifications: This gives the ability to alert your customers through email notifications when the agent comments on a ticket, solves a ticket, closes a ticket, etc.    CC Notifications: This gives the ability to alert the user emails added in the CC field when a new ticket is created by the agent or when a public note is added to the ticket by the agent or customer.    Reply Templates: This gives the ability to customize and prefill default information you want to be added in the agent ticket replies such as dynamic content like the requestor name, ticket URLs, and agent signatures     Note: Failure notifications related to the setup or modification of these email notifications will be sent to the Account Administrator.   Let's take a scenario where say you want to make sure your customers receive an email notification immediately after they raise a ticket to assure them that their issue will be fixed in 24 hours.     Here is how to do it:       Under the Requester Notifications tab, click on New Ticket Created.  The notification template for your primary language will appear.  You can personalize this using the content of your choice and including various placeholders. Click here to see the list of all placeholders available.   You might want to include the {{ticket.id}} and {{public.url}} of the ticket in a new ticket notification to provide better reference for customers.             When you are doing the same for the agent notification, you can choose which agents should be notified when a new ticket is created in your helpdesk under the 'Notify Agents' section of the template.   Post saving the changes, enable the notification to start sending out automatic email notifications immediately.  Pro and Enterprise plan users can send out these notifications in more than one language. Learn more here.        Agent Notifications     The following events will trigger an email notification to the agent if enabled. For these email notifications, you can include the ticket's URL, simplifying the process for the agent to access and review the tickets.       Event    When to use this    New Ticket Created    This notification will be sent to the select agents whenever a new ticket is generated in your help desk.  Tip: Make sure to add the required agents' names using the 'Notify Agents' button on the New Ticket Created template page    Ticket Assigned to Group    This notification is sent to all agents within a group whenever a ticket is assigned to that specific group.    Ticket Assigned to Agent    This notification is sent to individual agents when a ticket is assigned to them.    Requester Replies to Ticket    When a customer responds to a previously raised ticket, the assigned agent will receive an email notification.    Ticket Unattended in Group    This notification is triggered when a ticket assigned to a group remains unattended for a duration specified in the Group settings. You can include the elapsed time since the ticket was assigned to the group in the email body.    First Response SLA Violation    This notification is sent to an agent when they have not provided a response to the ticket within the ‘first response due time’ set for that ticket.  Available from the Pro plan only.    Resolution Time SLA Violation    This notification is sent to an agent when the ticket assigned to them has not been resolved within the specified ""due by"" time.    Available from the Pro plan only.    Note added to ticket    This notification will be sent out to the agents mentioned in “notify agents” when a note is added to the ticket by an agent.    First Response SLA Reminder    This notification is sent to an agent when the first response time of a ticket is approaching a potential violation.    Available from the Pro plan only.    Resolution time SLA Reminder    An agent will receive this notification when the resolution due by time of a ticket is nearing a potential violation.    Available from the Pro plan only.    New threads on my tickets    Notification email will be sent out to your agents and watchers whenever a new thread is created on their tickets.    New replies on my thread    When any agent replies to the thread, the agent handling the ticket, watchers and previously tagged users will receive this email notification.    Threads I am tagged in    When any agent is tagged in a thread, that user will receive this email notification.        Requester Notifications     The following events will trigger an email notification to the requester if enabled.       Event    When to use this    New Ticket Created    Email notification is sent to the requester after they create a ticket.    Agent adds comment to ticket    Whenever an agent adds a comment to a ticket raised by a requester, an email is sent to the requester.    Agent Solves the ticket    An email is sent to the requesters to inform them that their ticket has been resolved.    Agent Closes the ticket    An email is sent to the requesters to inform them that their ticket has been resolved and closed.    User Activation Email    When a new customer submits a ticket, you can create a customer account in your helpdesk and send an activation email.    Password Reset Email    Requesters will receive a password reset email when they request a new password          Note: If the requester - user activation email is toggled off, the email notification will not be sent to customers post sign up unless you trigger the activation email manually from the contact profile. On that note, the password reset email will not be triggered in such cases.      CC Notifications     You can modify the email notifications sent to user emails added in the CC field of tickets. There are two kinds of CC notifications:   New ticket created: This notification is sent only when an agent creates a ticket on the customer's behalf and adds a user as a CC in the ticket. CC notifications will not be sent when the customer sends an email with a CC user or when the agent adds a CC user in their replies because those emails will be delivered to the CC users' mailbox as emails (making notifications redundant).    Note added to ticket: This notification is sent to everyone in CC when a public note is added on the ticket, whether they were added by the agent/customer.      Workflow:      A ticket is created by the agent with a requester and CC email.   The new ticket-created notification is sent to the CC email.  The reply added to the ticket will not be sent as an email notification to the CC address because they will receive it as an email.  The public note added notification will be sent to the CC address - no matter how the ticket was created.        Event    When to use this    New Ticket Created    This notification will be sent to the CCed recipients of the ticket post-ticket creation by an agent in your helpdesk.    Note added to ticket    When a public note is added by an Agent or Requester, an email is sent out to the CCed user to inform them about the latest comment.        Templates     Freshdesk provides an option to customize how agent replies and ticket forward emails are sent from your helpdesk.      Every time an agent clicks on the reply button on a ticket, the contents of the agent reply template will be shown to them. For example, if you want all your agents to add the public ticket URL in their replies or if you want to standardize all the agent signatures, you can do that through the agent reply template. When the agents reply, they can add to the template or even edit it as per their needs.      Similarly, you can customize the agent forward template when forwarding tickets to third-party/external people in your helpdesk and include ticket details and properties via placeholders.          Template    When to use this    Agent Reply Template    Customize and prefill default information for all agent ticket replies using the Agent Reply Template.    Agent Forward Template    Customize and prefill default information that you want to include in agent ticket forwards using the Agent Forward Template.          Note: We recommend adding ticket ID placeholder with the format [#{{ticket.id}}] in the subject section of the agent reply /forward template to help email threading in Freshdesk.     How to add placeholders in templates:   Click on the Edit button next to the Agent Reply Template.  By default, the subject section in the template will only have the {{ticket.subject}} placeholder which fetches the ticket subject information dynamically when responding to tickets.  To add the Ticket ID placeholder in all agent replies, click the Insert Placeholder option and select Ticket ID from the Tickets option.     Click Save.           You can also customize and send custom email notifications based on various conditions in tickets via Automation. For example, you can send email notifications for a ticket being open for quite some time via Time triggers automation or an agent receiving a bad satisfaction rating, via Ticket updates automation. You can also include product-specific placeholders in your email notifications if your Freshdesk subscription supports multiple products.     If you support customers and agents across multiple languages, you can customize your default automatic email notifications corresponding to the user's language settings. For example, a requester whose profile language is set as French will get email notifications in French, while a German requester will be notified in the German language. Please refer to this article on how to set up multi-lingual email notifications.      Changing Font Settings     The default font for the portal     An administrator can set up a default font for the agent portal under Admin > Account > Helpdesk settings. This is the font that your agents will use while composing emails/replies to your customers. We have included more font family and font size options as of today. You will also be able to see a preview of how the font would look like.             Agent’s font preferences     If you want your agents to change the font format, then you can enable the ‘Font preference for agents’ option in Helpdesk Settings.          The agents can choose to change the font family or font size from the reply editor under the ticket details page while replying to the tickets when the option is enabled. When the agents click on the icon 'A', they will be able to view and choose the formatting options as shown below:               Frequently asked questions     1. Why are my requesters receiving two email notifications when a new ticket is created?     Apart from the default New ticket email notification (Admin > Workflows > Email notifications > Requester notifications), there might be a Ticket creation automation rule (Admin > Workflows > Automation > ticket creation) that sends an email every time a new ticket is created to the requester. Please check on the reported ticket's Show Activities to see if there was any automation rule executed on that ticket.     You can navigate to the corresponding automation rule by clicking on the rule link for that activity. From within the automation rule, verify if there is an action 'Send email to requester' within the rule. If so, you can remove this action or add another action 'Skip new ticket email notification' to the automation rule, to prevent notification email duplication in cases where this automation rule is triggered on tickets.        2. We are not able to notify agents when private notes are added on tickets. Can you check this for us?      The note added to ticket notification will be sent out only to the agents mentioned in “notify agents” section when a note is added to the ticket by an agent. In case the agents are mentioned and yet the notification is not received, please contact us at support@freshdesk.com.        3. I am not able to @ mention agents on notes. Can you fix this please?     Kindly hard refresh the current ticket details page once to check if this helps in showing agent list in the 'Notify agents' section of the note. If you encounter such issues consistently, feel free to reach out for support.        4. How does the system choose the email address for the notifications to be sent from?     If the account has more than one support email address, and one of the emails is set as primary, it will be chosen to send the email notifications.     5. Can I add multiple agents to the different type of email notifications?     You can only add multiple agents to the ""Agent notifications > New ticket created"" category. For other notifications, the assigned agent on the ticket receives the notification. If you require custom notifications, it is preferable to set up an automation based on the parameters of the ticket creation.

You can use the default email ID to manage all your email transactions. Additionally, you can add emails in other public domains, such as Gmail, Microsoft Office, or other custom email servers.  Any email sent to your configured email ID will be automatically converted to Freshdesk tickets.     User Requirements: Ensure that you have an administrator role to set up and configure Email for your account.    Types of Email servers  Currently, you can set up email in Freshdesk via the following Email servers:  Mail Server  Description  Freshworks mail server (default email server)  Manage all your email transactions in Freshdesk via the Freshworks mail server.  When you sign up for a Freshdesk account, you will receive an email address in the format support@yourcompany.freshdesk.com (also known as a wildcard support address) by default to handle your support operations via Email. Any emails you receive on this address are automatically converted to tickets with the customer as the requester.  Additionally, you can add multiple support emails in your company domain, such as support1@yourcompany.com, support2@yourcompany.com, etc for incoming and outgoing communications. For example, each department/team in your company can have different email addresses that can be configured with Freshworks to handle support.  To use the alternate emails, you must forward the emails from your current email address to capture them as tickets in your account. Each email added becomes the reply-to address for customers. See Set up emails using Freshworks mail server.  Gmail   Bring your existing emails configured on Google's mail server. See Set up emails on Gmail, Microsoft Office, and other Customer Servers.   Microsoft Office 365   Bring up your existing emails on Microsoft Office 365 and receive them as tickets in Freshdesk. See Set up emails on Gmail, Microsoft Office, and other Customer Servers.   Custom Mail Servers   Manage your email transactions through other custom or private email servers. See Set up emails on Gmail, Microsoft Office, and other Customer Servers.      Email setup combination  Freshdesk provides the flexibility to choose and decide the email setup flow. The options are:   Incoming Only: Allows you to configure and manage emails specifically for handling incoming email transactions. You can select from popular email services such as Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, and Custom servers (your own mail server).    If you use a non-public domain email (e.g., help@acme.com), Freshworks will automatically assign its own mail server for outgoing emails. This means you can use the default Freshworks email as the reply address to respond to emails.       If you use a public domain email (e.g., help@gmail.com), the default outgoing email server will be the same as the one managing your incoming emails (e.g., Gmail in this case). However, you can later update the settings to switch to a different server for outgoing emails if needed.      Outgoing only: Allows you to add and manage emails only for outgoing email transactions. Again, you can choose from Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, Custom servers     For this setup, the Freshworks mail server will be used to handle all incoming emails, while your outgoing emails will be sent via the server you select. This is useful if you want control over outgoing email communications but prefer to use Freshworks for managing inbound messages.    Incoming and outgoing: Allows you to add and manage emails for both incoming and outgoing email transactions.    Before you begin:    We recommend you to use a support email of your email domain to avoid any issues with ticket creation.  Only the emails received in primary folder of your support mailbox will be converted as tickets.  You can add multiple support emails from the Growth plan. However, if you are on the Free plan, you can add only one email.     Set up email using Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, and other email servers   Bring your existing emails configured on public domains such as Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, and other custom mail servers. For more information, see Set up emails on Gmail, Microsoft Office, and other Customer Servers.   Set up emails using the Freshworks mail server   Log in to your account as an administrator.  Go to Admin Settings > Channels > Email. You can see the default support email address. It is the same email you received when you signed up.   Click New support email.  Choose the preferred email setup combination and select Freshworks mail server.  Enter the Support email name and add your email alias. This will be your reply-to email address.   Configure your Incoming email system.   Click on the drop-down. To ensure that all incoming emails are converted to Freshdesk tickets, you must set up forwarding rules in your mailbox (for example, Gmail). You can do this while verifying your emails.  Copy your Freshworks forwarding address. A long forwarding address will be automatically generated based on the email you entered in the previous step.   Proceed with email verification.     Configure Outgoing email system: You can choose the same Freshworks mail server for managing your outgoing email transaction or choose other servers like Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, or other custom email servers.  Assign to group: Select the group (department/team) to which you want to assign the incoming tickets when addressed to this support email. For example, Billing, Customer Support, Accounts, etc. Alternatively, you can configure automation rules to automatically route tickets to a specific group.  Link this support email with a product: Associate the email with a product. You can set up multiple products and assign different mailboxes for each product.   Click Save. You can see the saved email on the Email list page. Proceed with Email Verification.   Note: Multiple product setup is available from the Pro+ plans.   Verify your email on the Freshworks mail server  If you use the Freshworks mail server to configure emails, you need to complete the verification process to be able to receive emails as tickets.  To verify emails:   On the Email list page, click Verify next to the email address you want to verify.   The verification process includes the following steps:  Configure DKIM  Verify emails     Configure DKIM  DKIM adds a signature to emails to verify their source, preventing impersonation and reducing spam.      To configure DKIM, click Configure DKIM. You will be redirected to the Email Domains page, where you can add domains. For more information, see DKIM configuration.      Verify emails and set up forwarding rules  Once DKIM is configured, proceed with email verification and configure the steps to set up forwarding rules in your support mailbox.   Note: Your emails will be converted to tickets only after you set up forwarding rules. Hence, make sure to complete this step.    Click Verify corresponding to the support email to be activated.     Copy the Freshdesk long forwarding address generated for the support email. Note: The long forwarding email address is automatically generated based on the support email address you enter while adding a new email.    Proceed with setting up forwarding rules. The verification and steps to configure the forwarding rule vary depending on your email client.       Set up forwarding rules in Gmail    Log in to the Gmail account associated with your support email.    Go to Settings > Forwarding and POP / IMAP.     Click Add a forwarding address. Paste the copied long forwarding email address from Freshdesk in the pop-up box and click Next.     A Gmail forwarding confirmation link will be sent to the forwarding address. This will be created as a ticket in your Freshdesk account.    To view the ticket, go to Freshdesk Ticket list view. Click on the confirmation link on the ticket to confirm the request.     Now, switch back to your Gmail settings, select Forward a copy of the incoming email to option, and click Save Changes.     You can choose from the following options based on your requirements: Keep Gmail’s copy in the Inbox - The emails will remain unread once forwarded  Mark Gmail’s copy as read - The emails will be marked read once forwarded  Archive Gmail’s copy - The emails will be archived once forwarded  Delete Gmail’s copy - The emails will be moved to Trash once forwarded    Once the forwarding rule is successfully added and verified in the support mailbox, return to the Freshdesk email verification step (see step 2 in  Verify emails and set up forwarding rules section) and click Next.  You will receive a Freshdesk test mail in your support mailbox to verify the support email. To ensure successful email verification, check if this test email is converted as a Freshdesk ticket in your account.  This completes the email setup and verification via the Freshworks mail server.     Set up forwarding rules in Microsoft Office 365  To set up forwarding on your Office 365,   Login to your Microsoft Office 365 account as an administrator. From the menu on top, click Admin > Exchange.  From the menu on the left, click Mail Flow.   Under the Rules section, click the '+' (plus) button and select Create a new rule.  Enter the rule name.   In the drop-down menu, choose the condition The recipient is to apply the forwarding rule.  From the next page, choose your actual support email address (support@yourcompany.com) and click OK.  In the drop-down menu choose 'Redirect the message to'.  Paste the email address Freshdesk provided (support@yourcompany.freshdesk.com or a similar one) and paste it in the 'check names' text box.  Now, click on the check names button label after you enter the address.  Now, click OK to leave this page, and click Save from the previous page.      Tip: To ensure only relevant emails are processed as tickets from Gmail or Microsoft Office 365, you can aet up filters or rules:

Set up filters in Gmail
  Go to Settings > Filters and Blocked Addresses > Create a new filter.  Define criteria with specific keywords like, email addresses, or domains.  Select ""Apply the label"" and create a label; for example,  ""Support Tickets"".   Set up rules in Microsoft Office 365:   Go to Home > Rules > Manage Rules & Alerts > New Rule.  Choose ""Apply rule on messages I receive"" and click Next. Define conditions such as specific words in the subject or sender's address.  Select ""move it to the specified folder"" and choose the appropriate folder where support emails should be moved. Click Finish and Apply the rule.     Manage your emails  You can edit, delete, and manage your existing emails from the Email list page:   Set a primary email address  Edit an email  Delete a support email  Configure advanced email settings  Forward emails from other/agent's inboxes to your support portal        1. Set a primary email address  When you have multiple support emails, you can mark a specific email as the global primary support email. To do this, click on the star iconnext to the support email.     When tickets are created through channels other than email, Freshdesk automatically uses the primary support email in reply emails. For example, if a customer raises a query from the portal by clicking on the ""Submit a new ticket"" option, the agent's reply will be sent from the primary support mail.      2. Edit an email  To modify the details of an existing email, click on the gear icon next to the email, make the required changes on the Edit support email page, and click Save. You can also change the incoming and outgoing email servers while modifying the email details.      2.1 Add email alias  An email alias is an alternate email address of your primary email account. This will be the default reply-to email address that will show up when your customers reply to your emails. For example, if your primary email address is support@acme.com, you can create an email alias as reply@acme.com.   To add an email alias for your existing email:   Edit your existing email address.  Add your email alias and click Save.  Go back to the Email List page and click Verify. You will receive a verification link on the email address added. Complete the sender verification. Once aliases are configured and verified, agents will see the original email address (support@acme.com) as the From address while replying to customer emails. Your customers will still see the primary email (support@acme.com) as the sender. However, when they respond, they will be forwarded to “reply@acme.com” as this is the reply-to address.   Few callouts to note:   If your primary email is on the Freshworks email server, you cannot add Gmail, Microsoft, or other custom email domains as your email alias.  For Gmail, Microsoft, or other custom mail servers, you can add either a Google email alias or a Microsoft shared mailbox. Once added and saved, ensure to perform sender verification.   3. Delete a support email   On the Email list page, click on the Delete icon next to the specific support email.  To delete a primary support email (indicated by golden star)  Global primary support email: Add another support email that is not associated with any multiple products. Mark the newly added support email as the primary.  You can now delete the other support email.  Product primary support email Add another email for the product. Go to Admin > Support operations > Products and click Edit next to the specific product. Add another email. Enter a new support email and mark it as the primary support email. Now, you can remove the previous support email.      Note: When you delete the support email in Freshdesk (for the Freshdesk Mail Server option only), ensure to remove the forwarding rule set up in the support mailbox settings.  4. Configure advanced email settings  Once you set up support emails for your Freshdesk account, you can configure advanced settings to customize your email setup. For example, you can allow agents to create new outbound tickets and choose to display their name as the sender on such tickets/replies. For more information, see Configuring advanced Email settings.     5. Forward emails from other/agent's inboxes to your support portal  Note: This feature is currently supported only in the following languages - English, French, Spanish, German, Dutch, and Brazilian Portuguese.   Sometimes, your customers may send emails directly to your agents, or you may have a mailbox with emails that you want to convert to support tickets. In this case, you can forward them to your support email from the respective mailboxes.     If you enable the For forwarded emails, use original sender as requester option under Advanced Settings, emails forwarded from a verified agent's email address will be created in the name of the customer (original sender) who sent the email to the agent. However, when you forward existing emails from a mailbox that is not associated with an agent, the requester will be set to the email address you used to forward the message and the timestamp of the ticket will be the time the email was forwarded.     Important: If you have multiple support emails configured in your account, emails sent from one support mailbox to another will not be converted into a ticket. For example, if you have support email A and support email B associated with your Freshdesk account, emails sent from support email A to B (or B to A) will not convert as tickets. This is done to prevent email looping.   In case you would like to customize this behavior, please drop an email to support@freshdesk.com.   Tips and best practices  Here are a few tips and best practices that you can follow to ensure that you configure the Support Email setup accurately:   Avoid typos in the support email address.  Ensure the support email and forwarding address are different when setting up forwarding.  Copy-paste the forwarding address correctly when setting up forwarding rules in your support mailbox.  Make sure IMAP is enabled in your support mailbox forwarding settings when using the Freshworks mail server.  Make sure you save the changes after adding SMTP/IMAP details in the custom mailbox configuration.   Make sure you have set up DKIM once the support email is successfully verified using the Freshdesk mail server.     FAQs   Can I disable automatic ticket creation when a customer sends an email to my support email address? We do not recommend disabling the automatic ticket creation from the support email address unless you have valid requirements. Removing the support email configuration impacts all the incoming email responses, and restricts their integration with your account, leading to email threading issues.  However, if you need to temporarily disable automatic ticket creation, you can disable the forwarding setup (IMAP) in your support mailbox that connects to Freshdesk so that every email does not get converted into a ticket.    Please note that no new tickets or incoming email responses will be created/appended to existing tickets unless the IMAP is enabled again. Also, you have to manually forward the emails from your support mailbox to record them in your account during this time.    How to resolve the ‘Activation code invalid’ error? This error can occur due to the following reasons:  when you incorrectly copy-paste the activation code while verifying your email.  when the support email address is invalid after triggering the activation email.  when the activation email expires because you initiate a new one.  In such cases, ensure that you copy-paste the activation code correctly and activate the link from the latest activation email. If the issue persists, contact support@freshdesk.com.      Is it possible to trace/check the logs for the outgoing emails sent from my Freshdesk? Currently, it is not possible to check the logs for outgoing emails sent from Freshdesk via the UI. However, you can contact support@freshdesk.com for this request.    I am testing the ticket creation after setting up my support email configuration. It looks like the ticket is not created. What could be the reason? If you use the same From and To email addresses configured as support emails, the ticket will not be created. Make sure you test with a different email as the To email.    How to add a shared mailbox with Freshdesk? Shared mailbox is supported in IMAP and SMTP. Ensure that the email address is in the following format admin@testkanha2.onmicrosoft.com\imap@testkanha2.onmicrosoft.com (or) admin@testkanha2.onmicrosoft.com\imap. 'admin@testkanha2.onmicrosoft.com' : is the email address of the user who has access to the shared mailbox. 'imap@testkanha2.onmicrosoft.com' / 'imap' : is the email address/username of the shared mailbox.    How to add a shared mailbox in Azure? In an Azure group email setup, if one of the emails in the group is a forwarding address, the system forwards emails sent to the group to the specified forwarding address.  Create a guest user on Azure with the forwarding address from Freshdesk <yourcompanycomsupport@yourcompany.freshdesk.com>  Invite this user into the GROUP or in the shared mailbox       I used Gmail to set up emails in Freshdesk. However, the connection was lost. If I reconnect, will there be duplicate tickets? how can I avoid them? By default, Freshdesk fetches emails from the connected inbox for the past 2-3 days (48-72 hours). This retrieval leads to a substantial number of emails being imported into Freshdesk. To prevent importing all historical emails, you can delete the tickets that were initially created during the Gmail connection.    How can I resolve 'Something went wrong' error while verifying my support email? I have already set up the forwarding rule and emails are converted as tickets. Check if the forwarding rule is correctly added to the support mailbox. If the setup is right, check if you received the Test email as a ticket in your Freshdesk account. You can also check the spam and trash folder to see if the test email landed there.  If you did not receive the test email as a ticket, but received it in the support mailbox, please contact support@freshdesk.com.    When I forward an email to the Freshdesk email inbox, it is added as a note rather than creating a ticket. Why does this happen? For every incoming email, Freshdesk checks 3 email markers to understand whether the email is a reply to an already-existing ticket. If the email is identified as a reply, Freshdesk performs additional sender email checks to make sure it's not spam and appends the email as a note to an existing ticket. Learn more here.    How can I check my forwarding rule settings and email settings for my support email?  To check the forwarding rule settings of your support email, go to your support mailbox account and click on the forward settings. You can reach out to your IT team to locate the forward rule based on your email service provider.  To check the email settings of your support email, go to your Freshdesk > Admin > Emails > Edit (settings icon) next to a specific support email and check your current configuration.    I recently added a support email under the billing group for group assignments. However, tickets are being assigned to different groups. Why is this happening? There could be multiple reasons why the tickets are assigned to an irrelevant group:   Support email is unverified: If the newly added support email is not yet verified, the group ticket assignment will not work as expected.  Forwarding rule is not added correctly: If another support email's forwarding rule is added as the new support email's forwarding rule in the mailbox settings, the group ticket assignment will happen based on the other support email's group configuration only.  Automation rule configured to assign tickets to a group: Check the ticket show activities to see if there are any existing automation rules to assign tickets to groups and modify the rules.      I see all emails are converted as tickets but I do not want some emails to be created as tickets. Is there an option to control ticket creation for emails? Once the support email is set up, all emails reaching your primary folder will be automatically created as tickets in Freshdesk. To restrict ticket creation for certain emails, you can set up a filter in your support mailbox level to move such emails to another folder. Alternatively, you can set up ticket creation automation to automatically delete/spam tickets based on certain conditions.    I clicked 'Verify' for the support email from the Product I configured, but I did not get any verification email.  If you use the Freshworks mail server, verify if you have set up the forwarding rules. If you use Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, or other custom mail servers, you will receive an activation link in your support mailbox to verify your support email.    Hi, how do I set my email address to be shown as from email when I reply to a ticket? By default, the primary support email address indicated by golden star will be the From email address when replying to a ticket. If you have more than one support email, you can use the Customize From Email address app. For more details, check here.    I see a banner ""Ensure your emails are delivered successfully by configuring DKIM. Configure now."" What should I do now? We have mandated the DKIM verification to avoid any email delivery issues if the Freshdesk mail server is used. Please follow the instructions here to verify DKIM.

Any emails received on your configured email will be automatically converted as tickets in Freshdesk.     This article contains:    Email Setup combinations  Use Gmail to set up emails in Freshdesk  Using Microsoft Office 365 to set up emails in Freshdesk  Use other custom mail servers  Configure incoming and outgoing server details  SSL and port details    Tips and best practices     Email Setup combinations  Freshdesk provides the flexibility to choose and decide the email setup flow. The options are:   Incoming Only: Allows you to configure and manage emails specifically for handling incoming email transactions. You can select from popular email services such as Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, and Custom servers (your own mail server).    If you use a non-public domain email (e.g., help@acme.com), Freshworks will automatically assign its own mail server for outgoing emails. This means you can use the default Freshworks email as the reply address to respond to emails.       If you use a public domain email (e.g., help@gmail.com), the default outgoing email server will be the same as the one managing your incoming emails (e.g., Gmail in this case). However, you can later update the settings to switch to a different server for outgoing emails if needed.      Outgoing only: Allows you to add and manage emails only for outgoing email transactions. Again, you can choose from Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, Custom servers     For this setup, the Freshworks mail server will be used to handle all incoming emails, while your outgoing emails will be sent via the server you select. This is useful if you want control over outgoing email communications but prefer to use Freshworks for managing inbound messages.    Incoming and outgoing: Allows you to add and manage emails for both incoming and outgoing email transactions.       Note: When you set up a custom mailbox, the last day's emails in the mailbox (both read and unread emails) from the Inbox will be fetched and created as tickets in Freshdesk.   Use Gmail to set up emails in Freshdesk  You can bring your existing Gmail or add a new email on the Google Email server to manage incoming, outgoing, or both incoming and outgoing email transactions.   Log in as an administrator.  Go to Admin > Channels > Support Email > New Support Email.  Choose the email setup combination (see above for more details).   Select Gmail, log in with your Gmail credentials, and ensure to authorize (read/write/delete) access to Freshdesk.    Once the permissions are granted, your Gmail will be successfully added to Freshdesk. Note: For successful SMTP authentication, ensure that you enable and allow Freshdesk to access (read, compose, send, and delete) your emails. If you continue to sign up without enabling this permission, you may see the following error:   You can view the email on the Email list page and edit it again to modify the details or change the server used for incoming or outgoing transactions.     Using Microsoft Office 365 to set up emails in Freshdesk  Bring your existing email or add a new email using Microsoft Office 365 to manage incoming, outgoing, or both incoming and outgoing email transactions.   Log in as an administrator.  Go to Admin > Channels > Support Email > New Support Email.  Choose the email setup combination (see above for more details).   Select Microsoft Office 365, log in with your credentials, and authorize (read/write/delete) access to Freshdesk.   Once permission is granted, your Microsoft email will be successfully added to Freshdesk.   You can view the email on the Email list page and edit it again to modify the details or change the server used for incoming or outgoing transactions.   Note: If you are logged in to your personal Outlook or Gmail account with SSO and use the Sign In option, the authentication will be done on your personal credentials. To avoid this, ensure to complete the authentication in an incognito/guest browser.   Use other custom mail servers  In addition to Gmail and Microsoft Office, you can choose other custom servers to manage your email transactions, incoming, outgoing, or both.     To add a support email via a custom Email server:   Log in as an administrator.  Go to Admin > Channels > Support Email > New Support Email > Custom.   Enter the Support Email name.  Proceed with the following sections to configure settings for Incoming and Outgoing server details.      Configure incoming and outgoing server details  Enter the following details:   Incoming Email Server: Enter the IMAP server name from where the incoming mails have to be fetched.   IMAP Port: Enter the port details. For details on ports used on different email servers, see the section SSL and port details.  Use SSL: To establish a secure connection, ensure that you select the Use SSL option.  Login details:   Choose the Authentication method based on your server settings. The options are Plain, Login, CRAM-MD5. Note: The authentication method varies for different email servers. For example, Gmail uses plain or CRAM-MD5 authentication. Ensure that you choose the correct authentication method.  Enter the username and password of your email account. Note: If you want to use a custom mail server for both your incoming and outgoing emails, fill in the details for both incoming and outgoing email server settings.     Note: If you want to use the custom mail server for both your incoming and outgoing emails, fill in the details for both incoming and outgoing email server settings.   SSL and port details  How does SSL secure your mail server? SSL (Secure Sockets Layer) enhances security by encrypting the data exchanged between a client (such as a browser or email client) and a server. This encryption ensures that sensitive information, such as login credentials, emails, and personal data, is protected from interception by unauthorized parties.     By converting plain text into encrypted ciphertext, SSL prevents attackers from accessing or tampering with the information during transmission. Additionally, SSL provides server authentication, which verifies the identity of the server you are communicating with.      This helps prevent impersonation attacks, such as man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks, where an attacker pretends to be the intended server to steal data. Together, these features ensure data confidentiality, integrity, and authenticity, creating a secure channel for communication and building trust between users and servers.

You can also learn about a few troubleshooting scenarios and possible steps to resolve them.  TABLE OF CONTENTS   What is DKIM?  How to configure DKIM?  Troubleshooting configurations with configuring DKIM    Troubleshooting DKIM Issues   General Issues  DKIM Verification issues  DKIM records not found       What is DKIM?  Domain verification is a mandatory check if you are using the default Freshdesk server for email communication. You can perform domain verification via Domain Key Identified Mail (DKIM ) and ensure that your business is Domain-based, Message Authentication, Reporting, and Conformance (DMARC) compliant, which includes SPF check within the DKIM records, making your organization capable of authenticating the communication between you and your customers.     Why is DKIM required?  DKIM generates a signature, which is attached to the message while in transit, to verify the authenticity of the message source. This signature is associated with the organization’s registered domain name. On reaching the destination, if the message has a valid signature, the email source is verified.      Hence no one can send emails impersonating your organization and support emails sent by Freshdesk on your behalf will not be marked as spam. DKIM also authenticates the incoming emails to be valid in Freshdesk as well.   DKIM plays a crucial role in enhancing email security, establishing sender legitimacy, and ensuring better email deliverability by reducing the chances of emails being marked as spam or phishing attempts.    The benefits of using DKIM are:   Email Authentication: DKIM verifies and ensures that the content of an email message has not been tampered with during transmission. This helps recipients trust the authenticity of the sender.  Sender Reputation: Implementing DKIM can positively impact the sender's reputation. Email service providers use DKIM as a factor to determine whether incoming emails are legitimate or spam.  Reducing Spoofing and Phishing: DKIM helps prevent attackers from impersonating legitimate senders, reducing the possibility of phishing attacks and email spoofing.  Improved Deliverability: Email messages signed with DKIM are more likely to bypass spam filters and reach recipients' inboxes, as it adds an extra layer of credibility to the sender.  Domain Reputation: DKIM contributes to the overall reputation of a sender's domain, influencing the possibility of successful email delivery.  Third-Party Services: Many email services and platforms require DKIM authentication for sending emails on behalf of a domain. Without DKIM, emails from these services might be treated as suspicious or rejected by recipients' email systems.    Note: Though DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) verification is not specifically required for a custom email server in Freshdesk, we still recommend configuring DKIM for your own DNS at your end. This ensures enhanced email security and helps prevent spoofing and phishing attacks.     User Requirements: Ensure that you have admin access to configure DKIM.   How to configure DKIM?  Before proceeding with DKIM setup, you need to first update your DNS records with the Freshdesk domain key so that it can be located and used for verifying signatures. The UI and terminology might change across different domain registrars, but the essential setup will be similar.    Here is a quick video on setting up and verifying DKIM.          To configure DKIM:   Log in as an admin.  Go to Admin > Channels > Email > Advanced Settings> Configure DKIM.  Copy the system-generated settings (4 CNAME records) to publish in your DNS server/domain provider’s account. This is a one-time configuration step per domain name.        Note: If you have the same records for other applications, contact Freshdesk Support. If you use GoDaddy, remove the domain name (under 'Host Value') before verifying the records inside Freshdesk. We will also need access to your Freshdesk account as an occasional agent to raise new records.     To update your DNS records with the Freshdesk domain key (In your domain registrar):   Login to your domain registrar’s control panel with the credentials used to register your domain name.  To change the DNS records, locate and click on the option called Manage DNS, Name Server Management, DNS Management, or Advanced Settings.   Look for an option to create a CNAME record.  Add the values copied from your helpdesk into the new CNAME record.   Repeat the above steps for each domain in the case of multiple domains. For example, support@tripto.com and billing@tripto.com require only a single setup; however, if you have support@tripto.com and billing@holidayto.com, you need to set up DNS verification individually for both emails.  Once you complete the setup, verify it in Freshdesk. Go to Admin > Email > Advanced Settings > Configure DKIM, expand the domain settings, and click Verify to make sure that the DNS settings are published correctly.       Troubleshooting configurations with configuring DKIM  On rare occasions, there could be a delay in successful propagation. Once it is completed, the admin will receive an email.  The time it takes to publish a CNAME record for DKIM (DomainKeys Identified Mail) can vary depending on several factors. Here are a few reasons why:      DNS Propagation: When you create or modify a DNS record, such as a CNAME record, it takes time for the changes to propagate throughout the DNS (Domain Name System) infrastructure.

Monitor the propagation progress using online DNS propagation tools or by periodically checking from different locations.  If you require urgent DKIM record updates, you can consider reaching out to your DNS provider's support team for assistance.      It's important to note that while the propagation time can be a factor, DKIM record changes do not typically take an excessively long time to propagate. If you are experiencing significant delays, it's advisable to double-check your DNS configuration and contact your DNS provider for further assistance.        How to check DKIM verification status?  An email is sent to the account admin when the verification is complete. One email is sent for each configured domain name. To know the verification status, go to the DKIM Settings. You can check the status of the DKIM verification:   Green check mark: Indicates that the DNS is verified.  Red cross mark: Indicated unverified DNS.         Troubleshooting DKIM Issues   General Issues  DKIM Verification issues  DKIM records not found    General Issues   If you get a '404' error while configuring DKIM, contact Freshdesk support at support@freshdesk.com with a screenshot of the error.  If you add an email, the domain will be created in DKIM automatically. To remove a domain from DKIM, navigate to Admin > Email > Advanced Email Settings > Configure DKIM, select the invalid domain, and click Configure if greyed out, or click Remove.  If you wish to add new records/domains for DKIM, contact support@freshdesk.com with your Freshdesk URL and plan details.  If the DKIM records are unique and valid but not verified yet, contact your DNS provider's support or contact us at support@freshdesk.com CCing them in the email.   If you receive a 'Domain verified in other account' error message, remove the records you have added for the account, exit the page, and then add the values again. If the issue persists, write to support@freshdesk.com with a screenshot of the error displayed.     DKIM Verification issues   Records not matching: There may be instances where certain characters are missing or extra characters are added in the DNS compared to what is displayed in Freshdesk. In such cases, the DKIM verification in Freshdesk may fail. Ensure that there are no spaces in the DNS.  Avoid spaces in CNAME record: Ensure that there are no spaces before or after any of the characters in the CNAME record.  Records not published: Even if the DKIM records are correctly added to the DNS, they may not be published. To verify if the records are published, perform a CNAME lookup with the CNAME record. A published CNAME record should look like this :    DNS configuration with certain providers like GoDaddy: When using specific DNS providers like GoDaddy, it is not necessary to repeat the domain when adding the host value in the DNS. For example, if the CNAME is 'host: fwdkim1.sauls.com' and 'value: spfmx1.domainkey.freshemail.io,' enter only 'fwdkim1' in GoDaddy, as it automatically adds the domain to the record. If you add 'fwdkim1.sauls.com' directly in GoDaddy, it will be added as 'fwdkim1.sauls.com.sauls.com,' causing the validation to fail.  Overlapping DKIM record values for the same email domain: When the same email domain is added to multiple Freshdesk accounts or multiple Freshdesk products, there may be overlapping DKIM record values. To address this, ensure that only a single entry is made in the DNS. It is not necessary to duplicate the same entry in the DNS, even if the values overlap. However, make sure that a single entry containing all the values from both accounts is added to the DNS and published for successful verification in Freshdesk.    DKIM records not found  If DKIM records are available for configuration in the Advanced Email Settings, you can perform the following steps:   Verify if a custom support email domain is set up:  Check if a custom support email domain is set up under the Admin → Email section. It is important to ensure that the domain exists.  Verify the status of the email domain:  Ensure that the email domain is verified. This means that the domain ownership and configuration have been successfully verified.  If the above checks are satisfied but the domain is still not available, contact support@freshdesk.com.

Any emails you receive on this address are automatically converted to tickets with the customer as the requester.      Additionally, you can also add multiple support email addresses to your email domain, such as support1@yourcompany.com, support2@yourcompany.com, etc for incoming and outgoing communications, streamlining support operations. For example, each department/team in your company can have different email addresses that can be configured with Freshdesk to handle support.     For each support email you configure, the reply emails from Freshdesk will automatically use the respective support email as the From email address.

Notes:   You can add multiple support emails from the Growth plan. However, if you are on the Free plan, you can add only one email.  We recommend you to use the support email of your email domain to avoid any issues with ticket creation.     Types of mail servers  While setting up additional support emails, Freshdesk provides you the option to choose the email server and email client with which you would like to manage your email transactions (incoming and outgoing):     Freshdesk mail server:  Manage all your incoming and outgoing email transactions via the Freshdesk mail server. If you choose to use this option, you have to additionally configure forwarding rules in your email client (support mailbox) to forward the emails as tickets in your Freshdesk account.      Other public domains/custom mail servers: You can also set up emails using your existing Gmail, Microsoft Office 365, or other custom email servers to send and receive emails through Freshdesk. This lets you manage all your email transactions outside Freshdesk.    Configure advanced email settings  Once you set up support emails for your Freshdesk account, you can configure advanced settings to customize your email setup. For example, you can allow agents to create new outbound tickets and choose to display their name as the sender on such tickets/replies. To view the advanced email settings:   Go to Admin > Channels > Email.  Click Advanced Settings.   For more information, see Configure Advanced Email Settings.

Requester Checks  Once an email is identified as a response to an existing ticket, Freshdesk checks if the sender's email satisfies one of the following conditions:  Sender's email address is:   Requester email address of the ticket  Agent email address of the ticket  Email address(es) in the CC of the ticket  Email address(es) to which the ticket was forwarded   Only when an email reply satisfies one of the Email Marker Checks and one of the Requester Checks Freshdesk appends the email response to an existing ticket.         Tip: To ensure that ticket replies are properly threaded and no duplicate tickets are created, you can check a few configurations in the Advanced Email Settings:
   Ignore the sender email address while threading replies to tickets: Ensure that this option is disbaled. If not, requester checks will not be considered while threading a customer response to an existing ticket.  Create a new ticket for each customer response: To ensure that each reply from the requester is threaded to same the old ticket and not created as a new ticket, ensure that this option is disabled. If enabled, each reply from the requester will be created as a new ticket.

For example, you can allow agents to create new outbound emails and choose to use their name as the sender and give a personal touch to emails. For forwarded emails, you can also configure contacts to be automatically created based on the reply-to address and the original sender.     To view the advanced email settings:   Log in as an Administrator.  Go to Admin > Channels > Email.  Click Advanced Settings.   The various advanced email settings you can configure are:      Configure DKIM  Set automatic Bcc email  Configure prefix for ticket ID  Allow agents to initiate conversations with customers  Use agent names in ticket replies and outbound emails  Use Reply-to email address to create requester contacts  For forwarded emails, use original sender as requester  Allow emails to be sent to the wildcard support address  Create a new ticket for each customer response  Ignore the sender email address while threading replies to tickets  Ignore the ticket ids in the subject line while threading replies to tickets  Detect automated replies  Enable all messages to be included as part of quoted text for agent replies  Create a new ticket when subject line changes  Flexible email recipients    Configure DKIM  DKIM plays a crucial role in enhancing email security, establishing sender legitimacy, and ensuring better email deliverability by reducing the chances of emails being marked as spam or phishing attempts. You can use this option to digitally sign emails sent from your helpdesk with your email domain name(s).  This  no one can send emails impersonating your organization and support emails sent by Freshdesk on your behalf will not be marked as spam.      Learn more about configuring DKIM here.    Note: DKIM configuration is not required for custom mailbox configuration, however, we  still recommend you configure this option for your custom email domains.   Set automatic Bcc email  Enable this option to include email addresses in BCC for all your ticket communications. You can use this option when you want to automatically add your supervisors or managers in email communications.      To enable this option:   On the Advanced Settings page, click Set automatic BCC email.  Enter the email address. You can add multiple addresses separated by commas.  Click Save.      Note: You can add up to 50 BCC emails.      Configure prefix for ticket ID  By default, for every incoming email, Freshdesk uses Ticket ID, Message ID, or a unique identifier to decide if the email should be created as a new ticket or threaded as a reply to an existing ticket. To learn more about how Email threading works, check Overview of Email Channel.     Additionally, you can configure a prefix for the ticket ID to ensure that threading is done accurately.     To add a prefix:   On the Advanced Settings page, click Configure prefix for ticket ID.  Enter the prefix name.   Click Save.  After you save the prefix, make sure to configure the subject line in all your email communications to include this prefix and ticket ID. Check the following steps below.    Enabling Ticket ID prefix in Email templates and notifications If you add a prefix to the ticket ID, it is important to configure the email templates or notifications to include the ticket ID and prefix in the email subject line. Once you do this, Freshdesk considers the prefix and the ticket ID for ticket threading purposes.  For example, you can add the prefix in agent reply templates:   Go to Admin Settings > Email notifications.  Switch to the Templates tab.   Click on the Edit icon next to the Agent Reply template.  Click Insert Placeholders and select Tickets  The Ticket ID placeholder will be added to the Subject.   Now add the prefix that you saved in Email Advanced Settings (check the previous section) page to the ticket ID in the following format: [#prefix-{{ticket.id}}]. For example, if your prefix is VIP, your subject should look like this:   Click Save. Now this prefix will be added to all agent replies sent from your account.    Allow agents to initiate conversations with customers  Enable this option to allow agents to send outbound emails using the New email option to new or existing customers. Once enabled, the agents can see the New Email option and use it to send outgoing mail. For more details, check Sending an outbound email        Use agent names in ticket replies and outbound emails  Enable this option to allow agents to use their names in the ticket replies and outbound emails. If enabled, the agent’s name will be automatically prefilled in the “From” field. If you disable the option, the “From” field will only have the support email address.             Note: When this option is enabled, only the sender's name changes to the agent's name. However, the sender's email will still remain the support email addresss.

To customize/add your customer name automatically in the ticket replies sent by agents, navigate to Admin > Email notifications > Templates > Agent reply template and add the contact name placeholder accordingly.      Use Reply-to email address to create requester contacts  When you send an email, the 'Reply' usually goes to the sender's address. However, when you use the 'Reply-To' address, responses will be sent to a different email.      For example, if the From: field displays support@yourcompany.freshdesk.com, but the 'Reply-To' is to 'support@domain.com,' any replies will be sent to this address.    For forwarded emails, use original sender as requester  When an agent forwards an email from their agent mailbox to the configured support email in Freshdesk account, the ticket will be created under the original sender’s name. If disabled, the agent will be marked as the requester.     In the following example, agent Rachel Doe has forwarded an email received from Sadie (customer) to the support email address configured in Freshdesk. Since the above option is enabled in Advanced Settings, the original sender’s name is marked in the email.  Support agents who have a personal relationship with customers may receive many emails from them in their agent    If the option is disabled, the agent, Rachel Doe will be marked as the ticket requester.   Allow emails to be sent to the wildcard support address  Use this option to allow users to create tickets by sending emails to any variation of the support email address *@yourcompany.freshdesk.com.     When you sign up for a Freshdesk account, you will get a wildcard email address in the format <support@yourcompany.freshdesk.com>. The wildcard support email address is the account's catch-all address. This means that any email sent to your domain that is not yet set up to be an email account or an email alias will be sent to the wildcard address for your account. This allows you to catch any emails sent to the misspelled email address. Emails to this address become tickets with the customer as the requester.     If disabled, tickets will be created only when emails are sent to the configured support addresses.   Create a new ticket for each customer response  Enable this option to create new tickets for every reply/response received from the requester on tickets. This means the responses from the customer/requester to a ticket will not be threaded to the original ticket instead, each response will be created as a new ticket.     Note:

The SLA policies apply to each new ticket created in this case.

Enabling this option may create duplicate tickets for the same issue. To avoid this and append all responses to a particular ticket in a single email thread, it is recommended to disable this option. Check this article to understand how threading works.

      Ignore the sender email address while threading replies to tickets  By default, Freshdesk checks for email and requester checkers to append the incoming emails as replies to existing tickets. If you enable this option, requester checks are not considered while threading a customer response to an existing ticket.  Assume when a distribution list is added as a CC in a ticket, and someone from that list replies, the system creates a new ticket instead of considering this as a reply because that person wasn't on the original ticket. To resolve this, enabling ""Ignore the sender email address while threading replies to tickets"" in the Advanced settings under Admin > Emails will allow replies from users on the distribution list to be appended to the original ticket.     Note: It is recommended to disable this option to ensure that email threading works correctly and no duplicate tickets are created. You can also refer to this video.   Ignore the ticket ids in the subject line while threading replies to tickets  Enable this option to choose the threading method for your tickets. If you enable this option, Freshdesk ignores the ticket ID in the subject line of the email, instead the ticket replies will be threaded based on the message ID or the span tags present in the email.   Detect automated replies  Enable this option to automatically identify automated replies in the ticket and not consider them as customer responses. This means if this option is enabled, the automated replies configured by customers will not be received at the support email address.   Enable all messages to be included as part of quoted text for agent replies  Enable this option to include all the previous messages of the ticket as part of the quoted text in agent replies. If disabled, only four messages will be included in the quoted text. Click the three dots at the bottom of the reply page to see the quoted text.           Notes: 

Agents can send up to 1MB of quoted replies when enabled this option

If you do not want to send quoted text in any of your agent replies, you can use the Remove quoted text app.      Create a new ticket when subject line changes  If you enable this option, ticket replies will not be threaded to the existing ticket when the subject line changes, instead, a new ticket will be created.   Flexible email recipients  Allow agents to add multiple recipients in the ""To"" field while responding to a ticket or sending an outbound email. By default, agents can add only one recipient in the To field; however, with this option enabled, they can add many recipients.  ",5,2024-11-27T13:34:08+05:30,50000178823,"omnichannel_growth,freshdesk_old_sprout,freshdesk_free,omnichannel_old_estate",Configure Advanced Email Settings in Freshdesk,"Configure additional email settings, like setting up DKIM, BCC email, and more.",,273387,Get Started with Email in Freshdesk,,2017-10-05T15:42:00+05:30,2024-11-20T10:44:55+05:30,161177,1,1,,6,161177,Email Channel,Use your email channel to its full potential with all the information you need about email ticketing.,2017-10-05T15:41:24+05:30,2024-03-14T12:54:26+05:30,6,configuring-advanced-email-settings,get-started-with-email-in-freshdesk,email-channel,/freshdesk/email-channel/get-started-with-email-in-freshdesk/configuring-advanced-email-settings.mdx
