The deprecation will have effects on all Freshdesk customers currently using TLS 1.0, and it is advised that you check if you're going to be affected. This solution article will walk you through steps on how you can check if this change affects your business.     Described below are the compatibilities across Desktop Browsers and Mobile Operating Systems.  Desktop browser compatibility     1. Internet Explorer: Desktop versions of IE 8,9 and 10 are TLS compatible if you are running Windows 7 or higher, but not by default. Future versions of Internet Explorer are compatible by default. Achieve compatibility by following the guide here.     2. Mozilla Firefox: Versions 23 through 26 are compatible, but not by default. Use about:config to enable TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 by updating the security.tls.version.max config value to 2 for TLS 1.1, or 3 for TLS 1.2. All future versions of Mozilla Firefox are TLS 1.0+ compatible by default.     3. Google Chrome: All versions of Google Chrome above version 38 are compatible by default.     4. Safari: Desktop Safari versions 7 and higher for OS X 10.9 (Mavericks) and higher are, compatible with TLS 1.1 and higher, by default.     Verify your browser compatibility     To verify compatibility for TLS 1.1/TLS 1.2 for your browser, go to this link and if you are able to view a webpage shown below with the message TLS1.1/TLS1.2 Upgrade Test Passed, then your browser is compatible with Freshdesk. Internet Explorer users can achieve compatibility by following the guide here.               Mobile compatibility     Devices running Android OS versions lower than 4.1 are not compatible with TLS versions higher than 1.0. Therefore, the Freshdesk Android app will stop working on devices running these versions of the operating system. Users are advised to upgrade their operating systems to continue using the app.     Devices running Android 4.1 to 4.4 need to be on version 3.5 or higher of the Android app to continue using Freshdesk. Users running Android versions 5.0 or higher will not face any issues and can continue using the existing version of the app installed on their device or upgrade to version 3.5 of the app.      The iOS app will continue to work seamlessly on compatible iOS versions (iOS 8 and above).     Once you have ensured that your Browser/OS will not be affected by the eventual deprecation of TLS, you can follow the steps below to run a compatibility test on your Integrations/API clients (if applicable)  Steps to check for API compatibility    Set up an API client in a test environment. This could be any software that you are using to integrate to Freshdesk or any custom integration code that you have written.    In that test environment, change the API client's endpoint hostname from yourdomain.freshdesk.com to tlstest.freshdesk.com.    If you see a '401 Unauthorized' error, then this test passed. This response means that the underlying TLS connection was successful, despite the '401 Unauthorized' error.    If you instead see an error message that involves TLS or https, then the test has failed. Your API client will require adjustments or upgrades. Please check with your client's documentation on how to upgrade to TLS 1.1 or TLS 1.2 support.    Example using cURL  This is how the output would look when connected from cURL.     (The following test cases were run on cURL version 7.50.0)  Failure case  curl -v  -XGET https://tlstest.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets --tlsv1.0     Output     * Server aborted the SSL handshake  * Closing connection 0  curl: (35) Server aborted the SSL handshake        Successful case  curl -v  -XGET https://tlstest.freshdesk.com/api/v2/tickets --tlsv1.1     Output     HTTP/1.1 401 Unauthorized  ….  ….  * Connection #0 to host tlstest.freshdesk.com left intact  {""code"":""invalid_credentials"",""message"":""You have to be logged in to perform this action.""}        If you've got any additional queries, just drop a mail to support@freshdesk.com              ",7,2018-06-06T10:59:51+05:30,18784870,"freshdesk_old_sprout,freshdesk_free,css_growth,omnichannel_old_estate,omnichannel_growth",,,,267729,SSL & Security,,2014-07-09T19:16:43+05:30,2017-07-29T01:21:45+05:30,4,1,5,,6,4,Freshdesk FAQ,Frequently asked questions related to Freshdesk,2011-03-16T16:37:03+05:30,2013-04-19T17:44:12+05:30,6,tls-10-support-deprecation,ssl--security,freshdesk-faq,/freshdesk/freshdesk-faq/ssl--security/tls-10-support-deprecation.mdx

Access the Admin Settings: Log in to your Freshdesk account as an administrator.  Navigate to Contacts: In the left sidebar, click on ""Contacts"" under the ""Admin"" section.  Click on ""Import Contacts"": Once you are in the Contacts section, look for the ""Import Contacts"" button. Click on it to initiate the import process.  Upload the Contact File: In the import window, click ""Upload a file"" (or) ""drag and drop your CSV file here"" button to select the CSV or Excel file containing the contact data on your computer.  Map the Fields: Freshdesk will prompt you to map the fields from the import file to the corresponding contact fields in Freshdesk. This step ensures that the data is imported accurately. Match the columns in your file with the appropriate fields in Freshdesk (e.g., name column with name field, email column with email field).  Review and Validate: After mapping the fields, review the data to ensure everything is correctly aligned. Check for any missing on mapping.  Import the Contacts: Once you are satisfied with the data mapping and review, proceed to import the contacts. Click on the ""Import"" button to begin the process.  Monitor the Progress: The import process may take some time depending on the number of contacts being imported.  Import Confirmation: Once the import is complete, you will receive a confirmation message indicating the total number of contacts successfully imported.      Note: If an existing contact is found in the CSV file, their information will be updated in Freshdesk.        For any errors while importing, please share the screenshot with us to troubleshoot further.

You can click this icon to export the report as a PDF but not as a CSV. However, you will be able to export both the Graph data as well as the Tabular data (Underlying data) present in the widgets in the form of a CSV.      Underlying data: The underlying data refers to the original, detailed information stored within the platform's database. Essentially, it serves as the raw material from which insights and reports are derived. This data provides the foundation for deeper analysis and understanding of customer interactions and support processes. It can be exported by selecting the CSV of tabular data from the widget.  Graph data: Graph data represents the summarized and visualized insights drawn from the underlying data. This visual representation offers a distilled view of key performance indicators, making it easier for users to grasp trends and make informed decisions without delving into the detailed raw data. It can be exported by selecting the CSV of graph data.   Steps to export the complete report as PDF      Go to Analytics.  Select a report you would like to export and click on it.  Inside the report, navigate to the export icon and select Export report from the dropdown.  Here you can select the pages in the report you want to export and click Export.            The report will now be sent as a PDF file to your registered email address.        Steps to export the widget level report      Go to Analytics  Open the report  Expand the desired widget  Click the options for the widget represented as three horizontal dots.  Select Export to email/Download > CSV/PDF of graph/tabular data accordingly    Below are the items you need to consider when exporting reports.   Make sure the date range of the export is correct and valid across Widget level/Page level/Report level filters. If the date filter is set different in the Page level/Report level filters, than the one in Widget level, the exported data may not have the expected results.  Make sure you are selecting Graph data for the trend numbers you see in a widget and the Underlying data for the complete data set of the widget. You can select up to 20 fields as columns for the export from the underlying data by editing the report, and adding fields using the 'Gear' icon as shown below.      Based on the volume of data, it may take several minutes to export and send the data to your mailbox.           Note: If the date range is correctly set and you still do not receive the export for the specified date range, try this troubleshooting step: edit the report, remove the date range filter, save the report, then edit it again and reapply the desired date range. Finally, save the report and proceed with the export. If you still face issues, reach out to our support.   To schedule a data export:    Login to your support portal as an Administrator/Supervisor.    Go to Analytics > click the gear icon(Settings) on the top right corner > choose Data Exports.    Click on Create Export.   Give it a Name, Description and choose a Module from which you want to export data: Tickets, Timesheet, Surveys, Survey results, Articles, and Triage.  Choose when you'd like to receive the export from the Schedule dropdown field (Daily, Weekly or Monthly) and then set the required time.  Set any Filters of your choice. All your dropdown and dependent fields will be displayed.  Choose the Ticket fields and/or Tag fields you want to include in the CSV file.   Note: It is not possible to use the date range dimension filter when creating an export via Data Exports in Analytics      To receive the export file via API    Copy and paste the URL in your Business Intelligence tool.    Once you hit the API from your BI tool, you will receive a response in the following format:    { ""export"":{     ""url"":""..."" } }  The URL parameter holds the link to the latest export file for that schedule. The file will be available for 30 days from the date of creation.       To access your data exports:    To view the exports that you had scheduled, go to Analytics > click the gear icon (Settings) on the top right corner > choose Data Exports.    You'll be able to view the Title, Frequency, and the Status of your data export here.     Click on the Title to open a data export schedule, and use the Active toggle to deactivate a schedule.    Use the download button that appears when you hover over a scheduled export to download the available data exports.    An export once scheduled, cannot be edited. You will have to delete it altogether and create one afresh. Use the delete button that appears when you hover over a scheduled export.

If the secure fields are enabled and later if you try to disable any of the mandatory sections the secure fields toggle will automatically be turned off.  Once the secure fields are enabled the IP whitelisting toggle and session preferences section will be disabled.  You will see a banner stating that idle sessions will default to 15 mins if secure fields are enabled. If you do not set 15 mins in UI, it will be automatically be set from the backend. This will not default to 15 mins in UI on enabling.  Session replay will be turned off when PCI is enabled.
